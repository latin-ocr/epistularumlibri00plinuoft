χ INTRODUCTION.

Pliny’s mother's family, the Plinii, also belonged to
Comum, and Suetonius, in his life of her brother,
Pliny the Elder, expressly calls him Novocomensis.
Besides this there are at Comum numerous inscriptions

Pliny's father evidently belonged to the municipal
nobility, and, according to Suetonius,2 his maternal
uncle was of Equestrian rank. Thus he was well born

time of the famous eruption of Vesuvius. This, as we
learn chiefly through Dion Cassius, took place on the
24th August, A.D. 79. Pliny therefore was born in
the second half of 61, or the first half of 62, A.D. On
the death of his father he became ward of the famous
Verginius Rufus.⁵ His mother, with her son, appears
to have taken up her residence under the same roof
with her brother, Pliny the Elder, who in the latter
years of Nero's tyranny had forsaken Rome and public
life, and sought the peaceful security and literary
leisure of Comum. In Plinfs boyhood, and indeed
