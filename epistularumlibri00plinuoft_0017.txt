IN TRODUCTION. xv

91, to December 9th, 92. At this time the tribunate
had lost all its former influence, the tribunicia potestas
of the Emperor completely overshadowing the annual
holders of the office. It had, in fact, become an
inanis umbra et sine honore nomen. Pliny, however, was
disposed to regard it in a different light, and conse-
quently abstained from pleading during his tribunate,
wishing not to expose a sacrosmzcta potestas to the
heated atmosphere of forensic debate.1

Pliny’s praetorship may be placed in the year 93.
About it he tells us nothing, except that he celebrated
the usual games, the luch Circensffl As Mommsen
suggests, his praetorship resembled that of Agricola,
as described by Tacitus 3 3—2'slem praeturae tenor ct
silentium ,· nec enim iurisdictio obvenerat .· ludos et inania
honoris medio rationis ct abundantiae (laxit. But, if noted
for nothing else, Pliny's praetorship is important for
the fact that it was during his term of office he con-
ducted his first great criminal prosecution before the
Senate. In conjunction with Herennius Senecio, who
was a native of Baetica, he appeared on behalf of the
Baetici, to prosecute their late proconsul Baebius
Massa. Massa was found guilty, and his property
ordered to be held in custody of the State, and Pliny
tells us that he was warmly complimented for his con-

duct of the case by the future Emperor, Nerva, who
was present.4
