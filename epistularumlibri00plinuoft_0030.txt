xxviii INTRODUCTION.

sequence. This was the prevailing view until in
1868 it was traversed by Mommsen who, aided by
additional epigraphical and other research, concludes
that the books are in strict chronological order, and
that the letters in each book are pretty nearly so, the
exceptions being unimportant. The following are
some of the points maintained by Mommsen :—

1. The words non servato, etc„ were simply in—
tended to give a stamp of agreeable negligence to a
collection which had undoubtedly been edited with
the greatest care. In any case the words prove
nothing, for the books may have been published
separately‚1 and the words may only refer to the first
book.

2. All the letters which treat of the same subJect,
or which bear sufficient traces of being contemporary,
are found either in the same book or in two consecu-

tive books.

lIt was a common practice in Rome to publish in succes-
sion the different books of a whole work3 take for instance
the cases of C. Fannius (Pliny V. 5.)‚ and of the poet Martial.
The words at the end of Pliny’s Presaoe, ita fiet ut eas quae
adhuc neqleccac iacent requiram, et si quas addidero, ‘non sup-
primam, seem to point to a similar procedure on Pliny's part.
There are also traces of this in the letters. Thus in his
letter to Cremutius Ruso (IX. 19.) Pliny says, siqnificas leyisse
te in quadam epistula mea. The letter here referred to is
VI. 10. We may therefore infer that when he wrote IX. 19.
the sixth book had probably been published. '
