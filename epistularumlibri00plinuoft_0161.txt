NOTES xvunvxx. 123

3. plerisque. “ most subjects.'’

utque corpori etc„ “ for as a sword leaves its mark on the
body, so a speech leaves its mark on the mind, not so much
by the snddenness as by the persistency of the stroke.'⁷
Gierig finds the simile obscure, without any reason3 and he
also, without reason, interprets corpus as any hard body, not
the human body. The passage is made clear by reference to
sec. 18, qui ηοη summit, sed z'nfigsz't.

4. hic, “ hereupon‚'' adv.

ostentat, flourishcs before me.''

Catonisque, i.e. Cato censor.

melior, i.e. eo melior.

5. signa, ‘⁶ images.'’ We must, I think, take the word in
this general sense, not, as Gierig, in the sense of legionary
emblems. Gellius, N. A. iii. 7, has the sanie collocation,
decoravere wionimentis, simiis, statuis.

6. inconprehensibilis, “hard to catch.’' Late Latin, and
occurs only here in Pliny. This word, with lubricus and
eludet, is taken from the wrestling ring.

pauciora dixisse quam ediderint. Pliny's opponent has
many instances here to back him. One naturally thinks of
the published speech pro Milone, of which Milo remarked
that had Cicero delivered that speech he (Milo) would not
have been enjoying the fine mullets in his place of exile
at Marseilles. The habit of revision and expansion was
common, and Quintilian xii. 10, 25, gives his sanction to it;
qnid? ergso semper sic asset orator ut scribet? si licebit,
semper. si vero quando impediant brevitate tempora a iudice
(lala, multum ex eo quod oportuit clici recidetur ; editio habebit
omnia. The context of this passage is worth reading.

Ι1. pro Vareno. This oration is not extant, but Quintil.
alludes to it, vii. l, 12.

nuda quasi subscriptio, “a bare statement of certain
charges, giving only the chief heads.'’ Subscriptio was a
document stating the nature of the charge ancl the name of
the accused, and signed in presence of the praetor by the
accuser and his supporters (subscriptores).

8. pro Cluentio: cf. pro Cluent. ch. 70. (Fausset's note.)
vetere instituto t e. 9. alone and without limit of time.
ne dubitare possimus, ‘⁶ leaving us no ground for doubting.'⁷
