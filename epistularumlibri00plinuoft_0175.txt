states to the Flavian cause, and defeated and captured
Fabius Valens, a defeat which decided the success of Ves-
pasian. Cf. Tacit. Hist. iii. 42, 43, 44. From Pliny ix. 37
we learn that he obtained the consulship under Trajan. In
v. 19 we find Pliny sending his sick freedman Zosimus for his
health to Paulinus’ estates at Forum Julii. In x. 104 (105)
Pliny writes that Paulinus has bequeathed to him the ius
Latinorum suornm (the patronage of his freedmen). See
Mommsen in Keil, p. 428.

nec liquet an debeam, ‘⁴ I am not sure that I ought to be.'’
Simply dubitative. So below, neseio (ιη izt.s-la:“whether
just or not Ι (10 not know.'’ In a prae-Augustan writer these
phrases would have ineant “ I am not sure whether Ι ought
not to be‚'’ “ Ι (10 not know whether it is not just‚'’ zze. I am
inclined to think it is just. The usage is frequent in Pliny
and Quintilian. The later writers indeed waver between the
dubitative and affirmative meaning of nescio an. Cf. Quint.
x. l, 653 x. 6, 13 x. 7. 29; Pliny ii. 12,1;x. 118. See Roby
,ξ 2256. It may here be noted that haud and haud scio αη
(10 not occur in Pliny.

the excuse, I have been rather unwell.'' After ut supply
audiam from the preceding auditurus.

ad. vinamzin villa. Cf. Cic. pro Rosc. 15. 44, uc aleretur
ad villamzz'n villa. Probably an archaic expression intro·
duced into colloquial speech. So Plautus, ad forum, ad
porcum. See Kraut 19.

To Nepos are also addressed iii. 16 (giving some stories
about the Elder Arria, wife of Caecina Paetus„ iv. 26 (in
answer to a request of Nepos that Pliny should have his
works revised. Pliny there calls him vir ‚araz-issimus, doctissi-
mus, disertissimus, super haec occupatissimus, maximae pro-
vinciae praefuturush vi. 19 (about the rise in the price of
land near Rome). Mommsen gives t-hc full name as P.
Metilius Sabinus Nepos. See Mommsen in Keil, p. 418.
