5. contra medias etc„ “ facing the middle of the
porticus. ⁷’

cavaedium hilare, “a cheerful inner court.’' The epithet
hilare may refer to the caraedimn being open to the sky, and
abo perhaps to the pieces of sculpture or frescoes which may
have been there. The word is applied in v. 6, 25, to the
apodyterium balinei oi the Tuscan villa with no such con-
notation.

Africo, “ the south-west wind.’' For its violence, cf. Hor.
Odes i. 3, 12, praecipitem Africum ; Verg. Aen. i. 85, creber-

fractis iam et etc„ “only by the spray of the spent
vvaves.''

valvas. These were folding doors, generally with two leaves
(biralrae); bnt sometimes each leaf was double, solding like
our window shutters.

fenestras. These appear to have been simply apertures in
the wall, closed when necessary by means of shutters. Cf.
Ovid Pont. iii. 3, 5, bifores intrabat Zunafeneslras; Amor. i.
5, 3, pars adaperta fzcit, pars altera iuncta fenestrae. Hor.
Od. i. 25, l, parcius iunctas quatiuntfenestras.

non minores, “equally large.’' The fenestrae were usually
smaller apex-tures, higher up. Here they reach down to the
floor like valvae.

quasi tria maria. See plan. It is to be noted that Pliny
only speaks of the view from his house, and never the appear·
ance of the house to an ontside spectator. In this he is
thoroughly Roman. The Romans, in building their villas,
seem to have thought little of a striking exterior, just the
reverse of us moderns.

a. tergo. From the back it commanded a straight view right
through the parts of the building already described to the front
of the house and the hills beyond.

6. retractius paulo, “ a little further back‚” τῖε. than the
triclinimn which in littus excurrit.

cubiculum, “ a chamber ’' or “ salon ’³ ; to be distinguished
from cubiculum noctis et somni, sect. 22. It may hav e serv ed,
as Castell says, as a kind of drawing- room for the guests pre—

to wait in.
