8. trecentis milibus, ἵζε. sestertium, over ;e·2‚400, septin-
yemis, over 155‚600.

ultimam poenam. Cf. Lucan viii. 395, qnoniam mors ultima
poena est. nec metuenda viris.

9. iure senatorio. Catan. quotes Aul. Gell. iv. 10, cra!
ius senatori nc sententiam royatus diceret ante, quicquid vellet
et quoad vellet.

erat enim consul, for the third time. Arrianus would hardly
require to be told that Trajan was consul at this time. So we
muslt suppose that Pliny intended this explanation for later

Ianuarius mensis cum cetera etc. If we take cetera as
accusative of respect, we may translate, “The month of
J anuary is noteworthy for other reasons, but also especially
for the crowd of senators it brings together.” If cetera be
taken as ablative agreeing with frequentia, we must take
celeberrimus in another sense. “The month of January brings
crowds of people to Rome, and senators more than others’>
I prefer the latter construction. January was the mouth
when the new magistrates entered on their new office.

11. imaginare. Cf. i. 14, 9.

super tanta re. Super has the ablative in prose, only when
it means “ concerning.’' Madvig, ἓ 230.

septemvir epulonum. The epulones, originally three in
number, afterwards varying, were a priesthood instituted in
B.c. 196 to regulate the sacred feasts, thus relieving the
pontiffs of part of their duties. In common with the latter,
they had the right of wearing the tossa praetexta. Cf. Cic. de
Orat. iii. 19, ἰιι pomffices veteres propter sacrificiorum ‘multi-
tudinem (res viros epulones esse voluerunt, cum essem ipsi α
Numa, ἰιι eliam illud ludorum epulare sacrficium facerent,
instituti.

13. perquam onerosum, ‘⁵ an exceedingly trying task.‘' Cf.
i. 8, 5, onerabit, note.
