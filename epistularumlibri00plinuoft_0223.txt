computat. For the Roman habit of reckoning with the
fingers see Professor Mayor's Note on Juvenal x. 249. Units
and tens were counted on the left hand, hundreds on the
right.

climactericum tempus. Climrrcter meant a critical time,
after an interval of so many yearS‚ when some great change
was supposed to come upon a person. The most important
climacteric years were the 7th and 9th, or any multiple of
either. The ss3rd year was regarded as very important, being
a multiple of the two dimacterics, 7 and 9. Cf. Aul. Geli.

been no mystery necessary, as the woman herself could have
calculated whether this year was a 7th, 9th, etc.

ingravescit. “ She grows worse.’' The word is more com-
monly used of the disease, as in i. 12, 5, but is here by a
natural extension applied to the person suffering. There is
no necessity to suppose with Scheffer that morbus has dropped
out.

qui sibi peierasset. Veranias’ words reported, not
Pliny's.

6. in caput detestatur. Regulus professed great love for
his son, and therefore such an invocation as this was supposed
to add to the solemnity of his oath ; aletesffnrz· means to pray
that an evil consequence may be averted from oneself to
some one else. Regulus’ wickedness was therefore twofold 3
he knew that he was committing perjury, yet he constantly
