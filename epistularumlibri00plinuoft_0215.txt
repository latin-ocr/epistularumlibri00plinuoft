NOTES xvn. 17 7

hortus pinguis et rusticus, “ a productivc kitchen garden,’'
as distinguished from the other, which was ornamental. For

pinquis, cf. Verg. Georg. iv. 118, pinyues hortos.

16. cryptoporticus. A covered cloister or portico. The
word is a hym-id, and only occurs in Pliny. This building
differed from the ordinary porticus in not being supported on
columns, but closed at the sides. The word extenditur shows
that it was a rectilffiear, not a circular building.

prope publici operiS, “ almost large enough to be a public
building.” As it was for walking exercise‚ length would be
a special feature. Cf. Hor. Od. ii. 15, 14, ‘nulla decempedis
Ι metata privatis opacam l porticus excipiebat arcton.

utrimque fenestrae, etc. “On both sides are windows, a
larger number on the side facing the sea; those facing the
garden are single ones, and fewer through the alternate corre-
sponding windows being left out.’' Keil’s conjecture is more
satisfactory, ab horto pauciores, sed alternis sinmdae, which he
explains ab horto siuyulae fene-strae alternis vicibus· ea· adverso
positae sunt, i.e. one window for every two on the opposite
side.

serenus dies et inmotus, cf. Tacit. Hist. i. 86, sereno et in-
moto die. Inmotzas in prose is post-Augustam.

1¹7. xystus, “a terrace walk‚'’ cf. v. 6, 16, ante porticam
xystus in plurimas species discinctus concisusque buxo.

violis. Violets and roses were the chief garden flowers
among the Romans.

repercussu, ‘ ‘ radiation. '’

quantumque caloris etc. “ The warmth it gives in front
is only equ-alled by the coolness it gives behind. ”

18. nam ante meridiem etc. In the morning when the
sun shone on the north-east side of the cryptoporticus. the
aeystus on the south-west side affor-ded a shatly walk3 at
midday, when the sun shone directly on the roof of the
cryptoporticus, the building itself was in the shade, and in
the afternoon, when the sun shone on the south-west of the
cryptoporticus, the nearest part of the gardei] and ,ιμκίαίίο
on the north-east side of the building was in the shadc.
The ‘qestacionis proximam partem was probably the *cinca
which adjoined the {ses-tatio.
