etiam cum labore. He fears that people may experienee as
much trouble in listening as he did in composing. The second
cum labore is wanting in ΜΞ. Med„ and its place is supplied
in the Roman and other editions by sic. Gierig has cum
labore eciam on the ground of elegance‚ and also because the
immediate recurrenee of cum labore without etiam intervening
makes the omission of the phrase in MS. Med. more easily
understood.

6. quotus quisque, “how few.’' Quisque is frequently
joined with a superlative or ordinal, which is always placed
before it. Roby, ἓ 2284.

haec, Le. so popular at the present time.

8. nam ut inis erat moris. At Athens the Thesmothetae
were directed annually to examine the existing laws, and note
any contradictions or duplicate laws. Besides this there was
the ’γραφὴ παρανόμων, or indictment which might, with certain
restrictions, be brought against any citizen who proposed and
carried a law oontradietory of any other existing law. The
trial of such a person would embrace a comparison of his law
with others. See Grote, Hist. of Greece, chap. 46. Pliny's
analogy in this passage is a very forced one. For the phrase
erat moris cf. Roby, ἓ 1283.
