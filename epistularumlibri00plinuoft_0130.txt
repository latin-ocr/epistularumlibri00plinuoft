VIII.

Pliny writes to Pompeius Saturninus asking him to revise
a speech which hc had made to his townsmen at the open-
ing of a library which he had given them. He hesitates to
publish the speech, giving his reasons, and asks thc advice of
Saturninus. About Pompeius Saturninus, pleader, historiam,
and poet, see i. 16. To him are written also v. 21 (9); vii.
7. l5 ; ix. 38.

destinassem, “ determined.'’ destinare in the sense of
ronstsz'tsnere, proponere sihi is quite classical. Gierig remarks
that Livy often adds the word (mimo (in animo also found).
destino in this sense occurs in i. 12, 9. 13, 7. 22, 12; iii. 5, 20.
li, ὃς v. S, 6. 19, 7; vii. 26, 33 ix. 13, 5; x. 15 (26).

addidisti ergo calcaria. etc, “you have put spurs to a willing
horse.'⁷ Cf. also iii. 7. 15, ωιννσηίιηη instz'fflmz. A proverbial ex-
pression, occurring as early as Homer. Cf. Il. viii. 293,
Ἀτρείδη κύδιστε, τί με σπεύδοντα καὶ αυτὸν l ὀτρύνεις. It
is frequently used by Cicero. cf. De Orat. ii. 44, currentem,
itt aiunt, meritare,- Ad Fam. xv. 15, acl pacem currentem, m
aiant, incitare.- Ovid, Ex Pont. ii. 6. 38, nia nocet admisso
subdere calcar equo. The same proverb is involved in Ex
Pont. ii. 2. 21, acer et ad palmae per sc cursurus 'honores Ι si
stamen hortaris jor-tius ibit equom. For the word addere, cf.
Hor. Epist. ii. 1, 217. vatibus addere calcar.

veniam recusandi laboris, “all excuse for refusing the
troublesome task (of revision).”

verecundiam exigendi, ‘⁶ delicacy in requiring it of y0u.''

2. gravari quod depoposcisti‚ “ to refuse a task on which
you have insisted.’' Lewis translates gyrat-ari ‘⁴ to be an-
noyed,'' but it clearly refers to remeandi above.

desidioso, see i. 2, 3. and 6.

vaces sermoni, “ bestow your spare moments on the address. '’
Cf. i. 9, 4. corpori raco. Sermo is something less studied
than oratio. Cf. ad Herenn. iv. ch. 52, of the speeches put
into the mouths of “personae ’³ in a description. Scheffer
may be right in regarding sermoni as an expression of
modesty. But is the use of the word not also due to the
fact that the speech is delivered 11οη apud populum, sed
