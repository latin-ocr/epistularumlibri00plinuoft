180 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM H.

corruptus, ‘⁵ brackish.'’ This is the reading of the Floren-
tine, Dresden, and Rieeardian MSS„ also of the Editio
Princeps and the Aldine Edition. &alsus is the reading of
the Medicean and Vatican Mss.. and also of the Editio
Romana. It is more probable that salsus is a gloss on cor-
ruptus, than that corruptus is a gloss on salsus.

26. suggerunt adfatim. For a similar phrase cf. ii. 8, 1.

vicus. What this village was we do not know. Had it
been the decayed town of Laurentum, Pliny would probably
have mentioned it by name.

una villa discernit. “Separated only by one residence
from my own.’'

balinea meritoria, “public baths‚'' i.e. which you hired.
Cf. meritoria (cenacula) Juv. iii. 234.

27. nunc continua etc. Continuat does not mean that the
villas were built together without a break, but that they were
built close to each other. Translate, ‘⁶ Now in close sucees-

sion, now at great intervals.”

sive mari etc. “ Whether you look at them from the sea or
from the shore.''

quod non nunquam ete„ “ a long spell of calm weather often
softens or loosens the sand on the shore, oftener this sand is
hardened by the constant beating of the waves.’' Some
editors take mollit as:⁴‘makes easy to walk on‚’' quoting
Caesar Bell. Gall. vii. 46, qual-qaid huic circuitus ad mollien-
dum clivum accesserat. Indurat will then mean “makes
diffieult,” a sense for which I can find no authority. This
interpretation has evidently arisen from ignorance of the
fact that water hardens sand.

28. squfflaS. In Juv. v. 81, squilla means a lobster. In
ῌοζ. Sat. ii. 4, 58, it means a prawn. Here it may mean
eit er.

29. inhabitare. Late Latin.

ut tot tantisque dotibus, “that the many great chat-ms of
my little home may be enhaneed in the highest degree by
{5qu eompany.” For dotibus in a similar connection, cf. i.
