Minicius Macrinus is the same person to whom Persius
addresscs his second satire. He was a native of Brixia (cf. i.
14, 5, note). To him are addressed iii. 4 (about Pliny’s
appearing for the Baetici against Classicus), vii. 6 (where
Pliny expresses satisfaction with himself for his discreet
reticence in the case of his client Varenus, accused by the
Bithynians), vii. 10 (about the same case), viii. 17 (about an
overflow of the Tiber), ix. 4 (enclosing a speech for revision).
In viii. 5, Pliny speaks in eulogistic ternis of Macrinus' wife,
whom he has just lost.

Vestricius Spurinna was, as it seems, Otho’s teqatus leyiom‘s
against the Vitellians (Tacit. Hist. ii. 11, 18, 23, 36; Plut.
Otho 5, 6, 7). He was consul two or three times. He is
mentioned by Pliny in i. 5, S; cf. also Mommsen iu Keil, p.
429. His active, regular, and studious habits are fully
described in iii. 1. Besides being a soldier, he was, as Pliny
there says, no mean lyric poet, writing in Greek as well as
Latin. The extant poenis ascribed to him aie supposed to be
spurious. Cf. XVernsdorf, Poet. Min. 111 351, seq.

triumphalis statua. The Emperor, being commander—in-
chief, was alone entitled to a triumph ; but bestowed on his
generals instead those various decorations and honours known
as triumphalia ornamenta.
