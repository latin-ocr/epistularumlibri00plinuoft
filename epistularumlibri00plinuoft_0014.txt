uncle and his mother near Misenum, his uncle being
in command of the fleet which was stationed there.
Then took place the eruption of Vesuvius, which
destroyed Herculaneum and Pompeii, and in which
the elder Pliny lost his life, partly through his desire
for knowledge, and partly through his anxiety to save
life. The two famous letters of Pliny to Tacitus²
contain a full account of his uncle’s death, and give a
vivid picture of that terrible scene. By the elder
Pliny's will his nephew became his adopted son. Up
to this time his full name had been P. Caecilius, L.
F. Secundus. By strict republican usage he should
now have been called C. Plinius, C. F. Secundus
Caecilianus. But under the empire there was a
relaxation of this rule, and Pliny now took the name
