156 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM II.

quasi. Construe with peractae, not as Schaefer and D'oring
with the whole clause. “XVas protected by a feeling of

pity for a condemnation which one might have thought would
have been final.’'

14. utcumque, “as soon as ever.'' The word in this sense
occurs only here in Pliny. Horace is almost the only writer
who uses this word in a temporal sense, and that only in
four places in the Odes, i. 17, 1ος i. 35, 23 ; iii. 4, 29 ; iv. 4,
35. Kraut, p. 32.

horis. For the ablative of duration see Roby, ἓ 1089.

clepsydris, “water clocks.'’ They were first introduced to
Rome in 131). 159, and were on the same principle as our hour
glasses, water being used instead of sand. For the time
allowed advocates see i. 20, 10, note. In this case Pliny
would share these clepsydrae with Tacitus; giving him per-
haps the half of the 12 originally allotted. We cannot
determine how long each clepsydra lasted.

15. studium, “ kind attention.''

laterique, “lungs.” Cf. iii. 9, 9, verebamur ne nos dies, ne
vox, nc latera deficerent, which very closely resembles Cic. in
Verrem, ii. ch. 21, nam me dies, vox, lacera deficiant, etc.

consulerem, jussive subjunctive, Roby, ἓ 1606.

gracilitas, “ my slender frame.” So Trajan writes to Pliny
x. 18 (29), cuperem sine querella corpusculi tui et tuorum
pervenire in Bithyniam potuisses. So Cicero in his youth.

16. neque enim iam etc„ “for a fresh speech could not
now be begun.'' For scinderetur the more classical usage
would have been dirimeretur, intcrrzmzperetur.

1¹7. [C.] Salvius Liberalis [Nonius Bassus] pleaded also in
Vespasian’s time. Sueton. Vesp. 13, tells how he was praised
by Vespasian, though, in defending a rich man, he had the
boldness to say, “ quid ad Caesarem si H ipparchus sestertium
milies habet?'' Under Domitian he was accused, and, as it
seems, banished (Pliny iii. 9, 33). We find him pleading in
the senate again in the Classicus prosecutions (iii. 9, 36,
where he is described as vehemens ec disertus). See Mommsen
in Keil, . 424.

disposiizus‚ ‘⁶ careful in his arrangement. ’³ Pliny here
transfers the quality from the speech to the man. Cf. Quint.
iii. 3, 2, ηοη tantum enim refert, quid et quo modo dicamus,
