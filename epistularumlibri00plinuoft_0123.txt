6. solebant. Gesner and others note the use of the imper-
fect as containing a bitter censure of the present time.
⁴⁴ Formerly (in better days) witnesses used to be‚” ete.

pietate, “ loyalty '’ to the emperor. High treason against
the Caesar (maiestas, laesa 711cziascas) is often spoken of as
inpietas. Cf. Paneg. 33. wmim' inpietas obiecta ; Tacit.
Ann. vi. 47. Albucilla defertur inpietatis ἱη Principem.

7. fas. To eall in question the decision of the Emperor

Caecilius Celer, as his name shows, belonged to the same
gens as Pliny. Itis to him probably that vii. 17. is ad-
dressed. He may also be the Celer to whom Maniai, vii.
ep. 52, refers as having been governor of Celtiberia.

Fabium Iustum: to him are addressed i. 11 and vii. 2,
and also Tacitus’ Dialogue on Oratory.

Spurinnam: for particulars about Vestricius Spurinna, for
whom Pliny had a high admiration, read ii. 7. iii. l. To him
are addressed iii. 10. v. 17.

mane (Cio. ad Att. iv. 9.). Gierig calls attention to the
cacophony.

9. “immo ego ad te,'' “ ‘nay‚' I replied, ‘I'll come to
yon.''' This would be only courteous on Pliny’s part to a.
semor.

porticum Liviae: MSS. Med. and Vat. read porticu. Cf.
v. 1, 9. convenimus in aedem Concordiae. The porticus
Liviae was built by Augustus on the site of a splendid house
bequeathed to him by Vedius Pollio, a Roman knight. In
this piazza a temple of Coneord was built by Livia : cf. Ovid,
Fasti vi. 637. From Ovid, Ars. Amat. i. 71, we also leam
that the porticus was adorned with pictures—

porticus auctoris Livia nomen habet.
