‘Lex Iudiciwiia of C. Gracchus, Β c. 122, all persons possessing
propelty to the amount of 400, 000 sesterces became x11 tuall)
equites, and had the imlicia, or right of acting as jurors in
criminal trials. By the Lex Roscia, Β. C. 67 (modified under
the emperors), those whose census was 400‚000 sesterces had
the privilege of occupying the first fourteen rows of benches
behind the senators in the theatre. A cen-<us senatorius was in-
troduced by Augustus, and fixed finally at a million sesterces,
unless we believe Suetonius (Octav. 41), who says that the
senatorias censzw was at one time fixed by Au gustus at 800‚000
sesterces, and ultimately raised by him to l‚·200,000 sesterces.
It is to laws of this kind that P. here refers.
