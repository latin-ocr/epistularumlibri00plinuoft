EPIST. XVIII.

C. Suetonius Tranquillus is best known by his Lives of the
Twelve Caesars. To him Pliny addresses iii. 8, granting a
request to transfer a military tribuneship obtained for him by
Pliny to his kinsman Caesennius Silvanus. In v. 10 Pliny
urges him to publish. 111 ix. 34 Pliny asks his advice about
a recitation which he is causing his own freedman to< gixc
instead of giving it himself. Ino* 1. 24 and 1n x. 94 Pliny calls
him his contubernalis, and 111 the last letter asks Trajan to
grant him the ira-s· trium liberorum, which Trajan grants. He
had been writer under Trajan, and was for some time private
secretary to Hadrian.

That Pliny believed in dreanis and ghosts is evident from
his account of the haunted house at Athens (which reads so
modern) and from the other details given in vii. 27.

however, Livy has gyem'lms se omnium advolvens. Tacit. Ann.
i. 13 has the simple accusative Tiberii yenua advolveretur. In
Ann. xi. 30, xii. 18, we find provolvi gyenibus.

See i. 5, 4, note. The centumviri originally consisted of 105
members, three from each of the 35 tribes. Under the
Empire their number was increased to 180. The 180 centum—
