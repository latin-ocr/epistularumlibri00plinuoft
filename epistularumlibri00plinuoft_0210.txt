172 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM ΙΙ.

orientem. If Pliny is speaking of winter-time, the one
window will face, speaking roughly, south· east, and the other
south· west.

occidentem retinet, “enjoys his last lingering rays as he
sets) ’' Admittit and retinet probably, as Gierig says, contain
the metaphor of a host welcoming his guest on his arrival,
and seeking to delay his departure. It 1s interesbing to com-
pare Pliny’ s references to the sun. There is a poetical touch
in almost all of them: i. 3 1; 11. 17, 7, 8, 13; v. 6, 15, aesti-
vumque sobm quasi imitat in porticum; v. 16, 24, cubiculum
hieme tepidissimum, qma plurimo sole perfunditur.

subiacens mare, “ the sea that lies beneath.’' We need not,
as Gierig does, give subiacens the meaning of vicinum. Cf. i.
3, l, note.

Ι7. huius cubiculi. ,obiectu etc„ “an angle is formed by
these salons and ‘che dining 100111. '” Obiecta strictly refers to
the projection of the triclinium3 huius also strictly refers to
the smaller cubiculum as being at the extremity of one of the
lines enclosing the angle.

continet eto accendit,‘ ‘holds and concentrates” 3 as if it
were a concave mirror. Cf. sec. 17.

hibernaculum‚ eto. This corner was exposed to the sky,
and the soil being, as we may judge, sandy‚ it formed a suit-
able winter exercise ground for the slaves. That Pliny did-
not use it as a winter resmt is plain from what he afterwards
says of the :nyseus and cryptoporticus.

et serenum etc.. “and only prevent them from using ‘che
place when they take away the fair weather.'’ All this points
to the sach thar the hibernae-ulum and gymnasium was
uncovered.

8. cubiculum in hapsida curvatum, ‘⁴ a salon with a semi-
circular bend, ’' zle. one of the walls formed a semi- circle,
somewhat like our bay w indow. The windows 111 this wall
caught ‘che sun morning and ev ening. Ιη haps. curv. cannot.
mean, as some take it, ‘with a vaulted or domed roof.'' Had
Pliny meant this he would have expres ssed himself
differently.

armarium. These cases or shelves are called loculamenta
by Seneca, de Tranquill. 9. sub. fin. tecto tenus exstructa
loculamenta. J uven. iii. 219 calls themforuli, and Martial i.
117, 15; vii. 17, 5. calls them nidi.
