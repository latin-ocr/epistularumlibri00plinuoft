110 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM Ι.

tradendis rebus Romanis celebris et eleqcmtia vitae. Persius is
said to have regarded him as a second father. Sueton. Vita
Persii, coluit ut patrem Servilium Nonianum.

clamorem : for the loud applause which greeted recitations
cf. ii. 14, 6, 10,

subitum ι this use of the adjective for the adverb is
common in the poets, with adjectives which denote relations
of time and place. Verg. Aen. viii. 465, Aeneas se matutina-s·
emebat,- Horace, Epod. xvi. 51, nec vespertinus circumagitur
ursus· ovile. M advig, Lat. Grani. §300, obs. 2.

4. quia non perdidit, “just because he has not lost one.''
I incline to Gierig's emendation perdidit as expressing P.’s
opinion, not that of the visitors to the stationes, but it has no
manuscript authority. If perdiderit be read we must take the
remark as a lepor, or subthety, of Pliny's, hard to be brought
out in English. The idler would be supposed to say, diem
perdidi quia non in stationibus fui. Instead of the last three
words Pliny artfully substitutes as the man's assertion ‘non

perdiderit, “ I have lost a day because Ι have not —lost it. ''
The subtlety is too subtle.

5. superbia, “contempt''

defui, “ failed to attend hardly auyone’s recital.'’ Cf. viii.
12, 2, milii deficit nunquam.

qui studia, etc. z “who loves learning without loving me

creditor: “as having established a claim on them to an
audience for my own works.”

audiendi officio: cf. i. 5, ll, note.

perit gratia, eto, “the compliment loses its flavour if a
return is asked.''

XIIII.

Junius Mauricus, brother of Arulenus Rusticus. About
Arulenus cf. i. 5, 2, note; about Mauricus cf. i. 5, 10, note.

1. foverit, “ fostered‚’' cf. i. 5, 2, note.

ut laudandus viderer, “he made me think myself worthy
of praise.⁷' Catanaeus interprets viderer = crederer, “be
thought worthy of praise by others.''
