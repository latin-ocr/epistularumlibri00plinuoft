necessitatem. Gierig's remark, that nervas-itatem applies
strictly to longulesw'wzae, is hypercriticism. thy should Pliny
not constrain Tacitus to write a short letter?

XXI.
To Plinius Paternus are written iv. 14, viii. 16, ix. 27.

2. decentes, “good-looking fellows.”

superest ut etc„ “it remains to be seen whether they are
honest.''

auribus, ‘⁴ by what you hear of them.’' A statement of
the age, country, merits, and defects of each slave was usually
written by the seller on a label (titulus) which was attached
to the slave’s neck. There is no reason to suppose, with
Do'ring, that Pliny here twits Paternus with not having got a.
character with the slaves, and having bought them simply for
their appearance. Pliny had probably not yet seen the slaves
(credo means “ no doubt ³⁷), and only knew of them what
Paternus had written, that they were decentes. I am inclined
to think that by auribus· Pliny also intends a sly, though
feeble, allusion to the piercing of the ears of slaves. If so we
would translate “ by ear rather than eye.”

XXII .

To Catilius Severus is also written iii. 12. He was consul
under Trajan and a second time under Hadrian. By the
latter he was appointed legatus of Syria and subsequently
praefectus urbi. He had hoped to succeed Hadrian as
emperor, but his design was discovered after the adoption of
Antoninus Pius, and he was disgraced. See Mommsen in
Keil, 406.

et quidem attonitus “and that too in a state of alarm.”
Attonitus more appropriately used of a sudden shock.

Titi Aristonis. To him are written v. 3, viii. 14.
