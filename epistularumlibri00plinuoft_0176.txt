138 C. PLINl EPISTULARUM ΙΙ.

Isaeum. The life of the Assyrian rhetorician is given by
Philostratus, Vit. Soph. i. 20. Cf. Juven. iii. 47, sermo
promptus et Isaeo torrentior.

facultas cf. i. 20, 18, note.

praefationes, “His prefatory remarks.'’ Not to be con-
founded with the prooemium, which is referred to in sect. 3.
The technical divisione of a speech were (1) prooemium or
exordium ,· (2) narratio: (3) confirmatio or probatio (state-
ment of arguments for the case and refutation of opponent’s
arguments) ; (4) peroratio. Cf. i. 13, 2, note, where praefatio
is used of the preliminary remarks of a public reciter. Cf.
also iv. ll, 2, 14 for the praefationes of Valerius Licinianus,
qui rhetor cle oratore-fiebat.

tersae, “faultless.” Cf. Quint. xii. 10, 50, tersum ac
limatum et ad lenem ae requlam compositum; ibid.‚ x. 1, 93,
caius [eleyiae] milii tersus «teque eleslans maxime videtur auctor
Tibullus ; also sect. 94, maltum esc tersior ac purus mayis
Horatius.

graciles, “ neat ’³ or “ ‘nerse'’ Cf. Quintil. xii. 10, 24, where
Lysiaca ‚ra-acilitax is contrasted with the ampler style of
Pericles and the other Attics.

graves interdum et erectae, “stately and animated”; re-
ferring to the style, not to the matter, as Gesner says, since
the praefatio would only contain the ordinary introductory
commonplaces, and no weighty argument. Cf. Quint. xi. 1.
31, where the plenum et erectam ec audax et praecultum (lenus
is opposed to the pressam ec mite et limatam glenus.

2. poscit controversias plures, “he asks sor several sub-
jects for discussion.” This differs from the account of Philos-
tratus ε-τὰς δὲ μελέτας οὐκ αὐτοσχεδίους ἐποιεῖτο, ἀλλ’ ἐπεσκεμ-
μένας τὸν ἐξ ἕω ἐς μεσημβρίαν καιρόν. Perhaps I had better
quote here the substance of Philostratus’ criticism ε--ἰδέαν δ’
ἐπήσκησε λόγων οὐτ’ ἐπιβεβλημμένην (exaggerated) οὐτ’ αὖον,
ἀλλ’ ἀπέριττον, καὶ κατὰ φύσιν, καὶ ἀποχρῶσαν τοῖς πράγμασιν.
βραχέως ἑρμηνεύειν καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ὑπόθεσιν συνελεῖν ἐς βραχὺ
Ἰσαίου εὕρημα. Controversiae were imaginary cases proposed
for discussion, each party taking a side. Such mental gym-
nastics were common. Cf. Cio. de Amicit. v, doctorum eet ista
consuetudo, eaque Graecorum vt iis ponatur de quo disputent,
quamvis subito. Frequent mention is made of controversiae
in Quintilian and Seneca. Suetonius de Clar. Rhet. i. gives
