EPIST. XVII.

Titianus is perhaps the same as that to whom ix. 32 is
addressed, though Mommsen apparently does not think so.

Titinius Capito. Pliny writes v. 8 to him in reply to his
advice that Pliny should write a history. In viii. 12 he is
described as incer praecipua scm—nli ornamenta munerandus ,·

L. Silani. L. (J unius) Silanus (Torquatus), exiled by Nero
on account only of his claritudo ‚qeneris ec modesta iuventa,
and killed by a centurion by Nero’s order at Barium in
Apulia ΑΛ). 65. Cf. Tacit. Ann. xvi. 7, S, 9. There is no
ground for identifying Silanus with the amicus mentioned in

Juven. i. 33, mafflzi delator antici, except the conjecture of
the Scholiast.

2. quantumque etc., “ to try what influence you have by
paying honour to othe1·s.'’

tion elsewhere. Cf. i. 10, 10, note. We meet a somewhat
similar expression in Cic. Verr. iii. 188, nihil quod antofnemc

Pretender in our own country when all hope for his cause
had been abandoned, and we may imagine the Romans
indulging in the same kind of observanee to their heroes
