etc. ; Cic. ad Fam. iii. 8 (sub fin.), cum et natura semper ad

communibus, ic. common to all men.

10. ludos aut gladiatores: the usual method for a rich
man to win popularity with the multitude.

annuos sumptus etc. : from vii. 18 we leam that Pliny
at first intended to give 500‚000 sesterces (about 264000) to
this object, but in order to guard against the principa]
being wasted, he made over to the agent of public property
some valuable lands, and had these reconveyed to him on
condition of payiug 30‚000 sesterces (about 5240) annually
as rent, thus seeuring the annual income for the purpose
in view. Iu this kind of liberality Pliny imitated Trajan:
cf. Paneg. 26-28.

porro, “in fact'': cf. i. 24, 4.

perinde, “equally.'' For this use of perinde with a positive

inducere plumas. But, as Gierig says, the words 72072v perinde
populare show that the eomparison is between Pliny's munus
and the munera aladiatoria above mentioned3 and inducere is
a common word for exhibiting on the stage or arena3 cf.

orbis, “the childless,” either those who have lost their
children or those who have never had any.

ceteri: some commentator-s refer this to the orbi whom
they would divide into two classes, (l) those who might expect
some day to have children, (2) those who might obtain the ius
crium, liberorum. To the first class expectarent would apply,
to the second mereremur. But I prefer Gesner's explana-
tion, who makes ceteri refer to all those parents who could
