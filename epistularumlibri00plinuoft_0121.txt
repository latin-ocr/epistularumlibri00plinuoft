NOTES 1111. -v. 83

2. Rustici Aru-leni. L. -J unius Arulenus Rusticus, brother
of Junius Mauricus, had published a panegyric on Paetus
Thrasea and Helvidius Priscus, in which he called them
sanctissimi viri. For this he was put to death by Domitian,
and his book publicly burned. On this occasion also the
Emperor expelled all the philosophers from Italy. Cf.
Suetonius, Domitian x, Tacit. Agric. ii. For Pliny's high
opinion of Rusticus see i. 14. ii. 18.

periculum foverat, “He had fostered the dangers which
threatened Rusticus.’' Fovere is more frequently used
in a· good than in a bad sense. Cf. i. 14, l. iii. 15, l.

Stoicorum simiam, “that ape of the Stoics.'’ Rusticus
is charged here with imitating the Stoics, whose spirit of
freedom and strictness of life made them especially unpopular
in Domitian's time.

vitelliana. cicatrice stig-mosum, “the minion of Vitellius.”
This probably alludes to a wound received by Rusticus when
sent by Vitellius, with whom he sided, on a mission to
Vespasian's army. Tac. Hist. iii. SO. The wound is sneer-
ingly compared to the brand on a runaway slave. The form
stislmoswe occurs in Petronius cix. Cic. de Off. ii. 7. has
stigmzatias = a branded slave. Pure Latin litteratus. See
Lightfoot's note on στίγματα St. Paul, Gal. vi. 17.

3. eloquentiam. In iv. 7, 4. Regulus is described as having
imbecillum latus, os consa-sum, haesitans linqua, tardissima
inventio, memoria nulla.

lacerat, “he defames.” Cf. Livy xxxi. 6. laceratus probris.

Herennius Senecio, another friend of Pliny, who joined
with him in pleading the cause of the Baetici (vii.
33). He was put to death by Domitian for writing in
praise of Helvidius Priscus (cf. iii. 11, 3 ; also Tacit.
Agric. ii. )‚ his accuser being Mettius Carus, a well-known
delator in Domitian's time. Tac. Agric. xlv. From vii. 27,
14. we leam that Carus had also laid an information against
Pliny, and that the document was found among Domitian’s
papers after his death.
