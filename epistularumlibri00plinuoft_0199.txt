pater alius, “ a second father.’' Alter is the usual word.

e primis, “belongs to one of the leading families.'' Ι (10
not agree with Gierig and others who make primis refer to
character, not rank. though it may include both. The con—
text shows that Pliny is talking here more of soeial position.
Gierig’s reference to iii. 2, 2, Altinatium princeps, makes rather
for my view, for there Pliny explains that he is not using the
phrase in the ordinary sense of soeial superiority.

citerioris Hispaniae, i. e. Tarraconensis, which extended from
Gallaecia in the north-west right across the north of Spain
and down the east side below New Carthage. It comprised
half the area of the peninsula. See Mommsen, Provinces of
the Roman Empire, i. 63-77.

scis quod iudicium etc.‚ “you know how sound and how
weighty the opinion of that province is.'’ Pliny may be
thinking of his tutor Quintilian, born at Calagurris on the
Ebro, and of Martial, born at Bilbilis, on a branch os the
same river, but I should rather refer iudicium prov. to the
succeeding words flamen proxime ficit. See next note.

5. ipse flamen. Of Hispania citerior. (Mommsen in Keil,
p. 430.) Mommsen would thus arrange and punctuate the
above passage :—pater ei in equestri aradii clarus: clarior
vitricus mater e primis. ipse ciffi-ioris Hispaniae (scis quod
iudicium proi-inciae, quanm sit gyrat-itas) stamen proxime fitis„
His grounds are that the absolute use of flamen is impossible,
aud that the iudicium provinciae could not be displayed in the
case of Voconius' mother, but of himself, the flamens being
created in conventu provinciae suffrayz'is legyatorum. This
arrangement certainly makes the passage more intelligible.

studeremus. This absolute use of studere, “study,'' is late
Latin. Cf. ii. 8, l, note.

6. seria, iocos, The phrase had in Cicero‘s time become
proverbial. Cf. de Fin. ii. 26, quicum ioca, seria, uc dicitur.
The masculine form iocos does not appear to have been used
till after Cieero's time.

¹7. facile, “ready.'' So Quint. x. 1, 128, says of Seneca,
inqenium facile et copiosum.

Musas ipsas Latine ioqui. So Quint. x. i. 99, licet Varro
M usas, Aelii Stilonis sententia, Plautino dicat sermone locuturas
titisse, si Latine loqui vellent.
