also Herodot. vii. 31, Aeliau ii. 14, about the plane tree with
which Xerxes fell in love, and which 116 adorned with a rich
robe and golden necklets and bracelets, and intrusted to the
charge of one of his Immortals.

Euripus, “that canal.'‘ The Romans ran watercourses
through their estates, both for ornament and use. These,
because of their flowing in different directions, were
called Euripi after the Euripus, between Euboea and
Boeotia, which was proverbial for its rapid chaug-
ing tide. Cf. ap. Suid. the proverbs ἄνθρωπος εὔριπος,
τύχη εὔριπος, διάνοια εὔριπος; cf. also Plato, Phaed. ch. 39,
πάντα τὰ ὄντα ἀτέχνως ὥσπερ ἐν Εὐρίπῳ ἄνω καὶ κάτω στρέφεται.
Smaller channels branched out from these Euripi, which
were called Nili. Cf. Cic. Legg. ii. l, Senec. Epist. iv. 83,
Plin. Nat. Hist. xxxvi. 15, fin.

viridis et gemmeus=“with its green enamelled banks'³
(Lewis and also Orrery). Viridis and yemmens are taken by
some as referring to the grass and flowers 011 the bank.
Others make (Jemmeus refer to the sparkliug of the water.

subiectus et serviens lacus, Le. Larius (the lake of Como).
Translate: “The lake below which gives such a pleasant
prospect.” I take serviens as referring to the prospect
afforded by the lake, not to the use of the lake in supplying
or receiving the waters of the Euripi. Cf. Paneg. 51. vec
unizts oculi-s· flumina, sontes, maria deserviunt. Subieeczzs like
serviens, suggests subordination to aesthetic effect. v. 6, 23.
piscinam qnae fenestris (cubiculi) serr-its ac seminecem i.e.
“ the windows command a prospect of‚'’ etc.

gestatio, “exercise ground.’' Gestatio, originally applied
to being carried in the litter, which was a large part of
Roman exercise, was afterwards applied to those covered or
open exercise grounds of circular shape bordered with trees,
wfhigh the Romans added to their villas. (Cf. Sen. Ep. 55.)

The qestatio is soft, yet solid, ι 1³. yielding to the foot, but not
so as to be slippery. Some say the path was made of lime
