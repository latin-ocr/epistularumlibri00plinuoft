144 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM ΙΙ.

ferre or referre alicui, i. e. to place it to the credit of the payer.
When he entered a sum as paid by himself to another person
he was said expensum serre or referre, z'. e. to debit the person
with the amount. For fier-z the Florentine MS. reads ferri.

3. nescio minor an incertior, ‘is about as precarious as it
is {ndggiitate suppletur. Cf. vi. 8, 5, nullus illi nisi ετ
fruqalz‘tate reditus.

4. in te vero ratio constabit, “in your case, however, my
liberality wil] be easily justified.'¹ For racio constabit cf. i.
5, 16, note; also i. 9, 1.

V.

To Lupercus is also written ix. 26 on oratorical style. He
may be the same Lupercus to whom MartiaL Ep. i. 117,
writes, but it is uncertain. If he be the same he, according
to Martial, preferred to borrow books rather than to buy
them.

actionem. This was some speech delivered at Rome on
behalf of the people of Comum, not, as some suppose, the
speech delivered to the Comenses to Which Pliny refers in
i. 8. That speech is called sermo, this actio, which shows
that the latter was probably a legal speech. Besides, the
whole tone of the present letter shows that Pliny is referring
to another speech than that spoken of in i. 8.

exhibui. Cf. i. 2, l, note.

2. intentionem scribentis accommodes. “Bestow on them
the same care as their writer has done.'' The words might
mean “the same attention as if you had written them yourself. ’“’
But the succeeding words support the first translation. For
intentio, cf. i. 3, 2, note. For accommodo, in this sense, the
simple verb commodo is more usual.

inter manus habui. Cf, verg. Aen. xi. 311,

ante oculos interque manus sum omnia vestras.

In manibus habere, in manibus esse are the usual classical
eonstructions. Cf. Cic. ad Att. xiii. 47, omnia quae in manibus
habebam, abieci ; Cic. Cat. Maj. xi. 38, septimus mihi Originum
liber esc in manibus.

3. existimationi, “ the judgment.''
