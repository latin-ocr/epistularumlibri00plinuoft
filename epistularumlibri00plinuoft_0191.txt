ΧΙ.

About Arrianus see i. 2, note. It is to be noted that most
of Pliny's letters to him are on forensia business. This letter
is about the famous prosecution of Marius Priscus, proconsul
of Africa. Juvenal alludes to him i. 49,

exsul ab oetam Alterius bibit et fruitur dis

iratis, at ίιι [ιέίείνίψυ provincia plora-s· ,-
viii. 120, cnm tennes maper- Alarins discinxerit Afros. Pliny
refers to this prosecution in the next letter, and also in iii. 9,
3, where, speaking of the prosecution of Classicus by the
Baetici, he says :—erac autem Priscus ex Baetica, ex Africa
Classicus. inde dietum Baeticorum, 'ut plerumque dolor eliam

personae, “ the person concerned.” This use of persona in
the sense of “ person '' is post-classical. The word is used in
classical Latinity as z character. Cf. Milton's famous attack
on Salmasius (Defensio pro Populo Anglicano, Preface), where
he declares Salmasius' description of the execution of Charles
Ι. (parricidium in persona renis culmis-susm) to be a multiplex
barbarismus.

famosum, “memorableff' The word is used by classical
writers in a bad sense : infiwnz's. Famoszcs is used in an active
sense in such phrases as famosi libelli, famosum carmen.

2. accusantibus Afris. In iii. 9, 4, we are told that one
African town only prosecuted Marius, but that the prosecu-
tion was supported by many private persons.

omissa defensione etc„ “ declined to defend himself before
the Senate, and asked to have judges assigned to him.” By
doing this, Marius virtually pleaded guilty to the charge of
extortion3 and he hoped that if his case were referred to
judices, the case would be confined to that charge, and
would simply end with a licis aestimatio, or decision that he
was to refund a certain sum, without any investigation of the

graver charges, such as that of having received money to pro-
cure the death of innocent men.'
