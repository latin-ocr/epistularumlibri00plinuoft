168 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM ΙΙ.

not bound to pay them. See Dict. Antiq. s. v. Testamentum.
Doring seems to say that if Pliny disregarded the codicilli he
would take the whole of the property. But Ι think Pliny ιε
speaking only of whether he should take the half of the estate
willed to him, in its entirety, or pay out of it the legacies
directed by the invalid codicilli.

1. ex parte heredem, “heir to half his estate.’' Where the
word pars is used without such qualification as tertia, quarta
etc., it means one half.

2. iure deficerentur. The mss. and old editions are
divided between dejicerentur and deficerent. Both construc-
tions are common. For the passive use, cf. Epis. ii. 17, 25;
x. 90 (91), Sinopenses, domine, aqua deficiantur. Sichard's con-
jecture iura deficerent is also defensible in point of syntax,
whether we regard [ara as nominative or as accusative, though
the latter construction is unusual. Cf. Verg. Georg. i. 148,
cum iam {slandes atque arbuta sacrae Ι deficerent silvae, and
Conington's note.

perfectas, ‘valid.'

3. delatori locus non sit. Not because of the exile of the
delatores under Trajan, but because Pliny, in distributing his
share of the inheritance, was exercising a strictly legal right.
which no informer could interfere with. The calm mention of
delator here gives us an insight into these times and the posi-
tion of these informers, who were regarded as a public insti-
tution. A delator would of course have received a see for in-
validating Pliny's right to deal with his inheritance, and for
turning it over to the public treasury.

4. subsedit, ‘ has reverted to me. Cf. iv. 12, 2, cnm in
provinciam quaestor exisset scribamque, qui sorti obtislerat, ante
leyitimum salarii tempus amisisset, qnod acceperat scribae da-
turus intellexit et statuit s a b s i cl ere apud se uon oportere, i.e.
ought not to remain in his hands.

XVII.

Gallo. This may be the same Gallus to whom are written
iv. 17 and viii. 20 (about the wonderful lake with floating
islands). He may be the Gallus mentioned in i. 7, but all is
conjecture.
