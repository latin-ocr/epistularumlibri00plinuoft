INTRODUCTION. xix

the consulship, Cornutus Tertullus, is spoken of
during its progress as consul desiqnatusfl Both
Pliny and Tertullus continued to hold the prae-
fectura aerarii along with the consulship.2 At
this time the latter office was only held for two
months, and Pliny and Cornutus were consuls
in September and October, A.D. 100. It was
therefore on the lst of September, 100, that Pliny
' delivered his Panegyric, the usual speech of thanks
to the Emperor made by one of the consuls on the
day of their entry on office. The Panegyric is the
only specimen we have of Pliny’s oratory, and it
can hardly be called a pure specimen, for it under-
went repeated revision3 and careful recasting before
its publication. It is more valuable as an authorita-
tive account of the events of the first three years

Comum, and evidently a man of distinction, as we
can gather from an inscription referring to him still
at Comum, and quoted by Mommsen.4 She was a
mere girl when he married her, probably an orphan,
and trained by her aunt Calpurnia Hispulla who had
been an intimate friend of Pliny's mother.5 Calpurnia
