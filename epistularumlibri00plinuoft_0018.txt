But now a change was coming over Domitian, and
there began that time of murder, exile, and confisca-
tion, which was to deprive Pliny of so many of his
friends. Herennius Senecio, Arulenus Rusticus, and
Helvidius Priscus were put to death, while Junius
Mauricus, the brother of Arulenus, and noble women,
such as Gratilla, and Arria the daughter and Fannia
the grand-daughter of Caecina Paetus and the elder
Arria, were sent into exile. So many thunderbolts
were falling round him that Pliny felt himself scorched
by them, and augured from certain signs that a
similar fate was impending over himself.l He tells
us that after Domitian's death an information against
him by the informer Metius Carus was found among
the Emperor’s papers.2 In the Panegyricss he says,
eursu quodam provectus ab illo tusidiosisstmo principe,
antequam profiteretur odium bonorum, postquam professus
est, substiti ,· and he goes on to say that he preferred the
longer road to office rather than the short cuts which
he might have taken by becoming adelator or aminion
of the tyrant. There is no doubt that Pliny’s gentle
and refined nature would have made him shrink from
office at this time, but it is just possible that in the
above words he depreciates Domitian too much before
Trajan. For it is evident that the former Emperor, in
the midst of his worst excesses, did not neglect Pliny3
for he appointed him to the praefectura aerarii militaris,
