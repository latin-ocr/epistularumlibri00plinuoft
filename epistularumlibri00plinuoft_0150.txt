of the ornamenta praetoria. The latter embraced only the
insignia of the rank, without any of its political rights. It
was the shadow without the substance. See Marquardt.

ambitioni dicam an dignitati, “this show, οι· shall I call
it dignity.'’ Juveu. iii. 182. ambitiosa paupertate z preten-
tious poverty. Compare what P. says os Arrianus Maturus,
iii. 2, 4, sc in equestri {Jradu tenuit, czmzsacilc posset adscendere

the opposition between it and diysnz'tas is lost.

6. municipio Patavino, Patavium (Padua) the capital of the
Veneti.

contigit et etc„ “he has been fortunate 111 having as uncle
P. Acilius.'’ We know nothing about this Acilius. Per·
haps he may be the person to whom iii. 14 is addressed.
There is also an Acilius Rufus mentioned (as consul desifflzatus)
v. 20, 6; also in vi. 153, Γ).

percucurrit, “held 111 rapisl succession.⁷' Suetou. Nero 3,
restitutus in patriam amplissimos honores percucurrit. In Pliny
vi. 6, 2, we have decucurri (not of course implying rapidity),
and cursus honorum, decursus honorum, are frequently used by
Cicero. The metaphor in percucurrit is either from the
stadium or from sailing.

which he had yet to hold, was in the gift of the Emperor.

8. est ini facies etc„ “his face shows his gentle birth,
with its ruddy hue, often deepened by a blush.'’ Corte
thinks mullo rubore a gloss on multo sanquine. Gierig suggests
pudore for rubore. There seems to me nothing objectionable
in the passage. It simply mea-ns that Acilianus had a bright
complexion and often blushed.
