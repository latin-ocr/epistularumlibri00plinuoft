two instauces. The reading pouit. which Gierig adopts, is
against the authority of all the manuscripts. (lierig adopts
his reading for three reasons. (l) Because ponere is the word

commonly used in the schools of rhetoric and philosophy.
But that does not prove that poscere is wrong. (⁴2) Because
Isaeus would have been foolish to take such a roundabout
way, first asking his audience for a number of subjeets and
then giving them a further choice. Why not ask for one
subject and have done with it? The answer is that Isaeus
asks for subjects to show that he had not come prepared. He
asks for several that he may not seem to be in collusion with
any one of his audience, as he might have seelned had he
asked only for one and one been suggested by a single auditor.
(3) Because poscit is at variance with the account of Philo-
stratus. But Pliny differs from Philostratus elsewhere in the
letter.

partes, “the side he is to take.'' Some make parles refer
to the divisions of the speech, the audience being allowed to
choose where Isaeus is to begin, whether with prooemium or
narratio, ete. that follows is, I think, against this meaning.

amicitur, “he arranges his dress‚'' i.e. his pallium, for he
would dress as a Greek. Or amicitur may mean “ puts on his
pallium,’' as is seen from Quint. xi. 3, 156, leniter con-surgen
dum ‚· tum in componenda toqa, vel, si necesse erit, etiam ex
inteqro inicienda paulum est commorandum, ut et
amictus sit decentior et protinus aliquid spatii ad coyitsmzdum.
Cf. Plin. iv. ll, 3 (of Valerius Licinianus), idem cum Graeco
ραῖῖξὶο amictus intrasset, postquam se composuit, circumspexitque
Ιια itum suum.

sensus reconditi, ‘² deep thoughts.'’ In opposition to verba.

3. prooemiatur etc„ alate word, formed from the Greek
προοιμιάζεσθαι. “His preludes are to the point (prooemium
or exordium), his statements of his case are clear (narratio),
his arguments incisive (probatio), his conclusions foreible.”
Here there is a general correspondence to the rhetorical divi-
sions of a speech. The 4th division (peroratio) is omitted,
unless we take colliffl't in that sense. In vi. l, 1, Quint.
divides the peroratio into two parts, one of which is rerum
repetitio et conyreyatzb, quae Graece dicitur ἀνακεφαλαίωσις, α
quibusdam Latinorum enumeratio. Cf. also Cic. Brut. 88,
320, collectiones. From which we miqht conclude that by
