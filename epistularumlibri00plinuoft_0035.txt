INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

The first was discovered at Fecchio, a small village
not far from Comum. Later it was transferred to
Milan in the Archinti collection, with which it sub-
sequently passed into the museum known by the
name of Brera.

The second is the great inscription which once
adorned the walls of the Thermae which Pliny gave
to Comum. The marble slab was discovered in Milan,
and had got broken into six pieceS‚ four of which were
built into a tomb in the Church of St. Ambrose.
These four fragments subsequently disappeared‚ and
it was only in 1858 that the first fragment was re—
discovered in the church of St. Ambrose. By the
aid of this fragment and various written records
Mommsen has reproduced the complete inscription
as given above.
