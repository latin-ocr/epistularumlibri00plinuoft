NOTES v’m. -vnn, 97

16. decuriones: the senators of the municipia were so
galled.. ‘They were presided over by two officers called
uuna-zm.

1¹7. adsentationem adclamationemque‚ “the approbation
and applause.'’ In Cicero adclamatio, adclamare seem to be
always used in an unfavourable sense.

limine curiae etc.‚ “exeluded from the threshold and
precincts of the council chamber.”

obvia ostentatione conquirere, “to catch by a bare-faeed
display of it ’' (my liberality). The reading adsentatione
gains some support from the preceding words in speciem
anzbi‘ionis.

18. cuius auctoritas, “ and its authority will be to me a
sufficient reason for what Ι am to do.'' cubus might reter to
an antecedent contained in tuo, “ and your authority.²' Cf. i.

20, 24. where Pliny prefers not to yield to authority but to

VIIII.

To Minicius Fundanus are addressed iv. 153 vi. 6. In the
first of these Pliny speaks of him as likely to become consul
the next year, and writes reeommending Asinius Bassus as
his quaestor. In v. 16 there is a panegyric on Fundanus'
youngest daughter who had died, and the father is spoken of
as eruditus et sapien-5, πί qui se ab ineunte aetate altioribus
studiis artibusque dediderit. See Mommsen in Keil 419.

1. mirum est etc.‚ “strange what a good account we can
give or think we can give of each separate day spent in the
city, but how poor our general account of a number of days,'’
i.e. we ean. give a good account of each separate day, but at
the end, say of a mouth, we have nothing to show for the
time, i.e. we find the time has been frittered away. For
ratio constet see i. 5, 16. note. For cunctaque some read
czmctisque, which is evidently the alteration of an ignorant
scribe; others iunctisque.

cuncta, i.e. ratio. cuncta ratio is defined by Corte as
plurium dierum simul collecta ratio, cancta being=coniuncta.

2. officio togae etc. : “ Ι have been present at a ceremony
of assuming the gown of manhood,'’ i.e. “ at a coming of age.⁷'
For officio, see i. 5, 11, note. Coneerning the important
