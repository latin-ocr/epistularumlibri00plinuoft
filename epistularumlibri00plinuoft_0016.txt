xiv INTRODUCTION.

equitum Romanorzmz. Of this office, as of his decem-
vitate, Pliny makes no express mention, and it seems
to have been merely an ornamental sinecure. The
next step in the ladder of promotion was the quaestor-
ship. But Pliny could not hold this before he was
twenty-five years old.1 The interval of waiting was
spent in forensic work in the Court of the Centumviri,
which sat in the Basilica J ulia. This Court was
Pliny's youthful arena, where he won his first case,
and he continued to plead init long after he had risen
to 611111161166.2

Pliny was quaestor probably from June lst, 89, fill
May 3lst, 90, having already exceeded the minimum
age, which may have been due to the great competi·
tion for the office. At any rate, he seems not to have
been kept back for want of influence, andvhe enjoyed
the privilege on the present occasion of being quaestor
Caesaris, having been nominated by Domitian himself.
After the quaestorship‚ a full year had to elapse before
the tribunate could be held. Exception might be
made to this rule if the candidate enjoyed the ius trium
liberorum. As Pliny did not possess this privilege, he
must have waited the statutable year, and thus wc
may date his tribunate as lasting from December lOth,

lIt was probably shortly after his return from Bithynia,
certainly not before the reign of Domitian, that Pliny married
his first wife. Cf. Ep. I. 18, 3; X. 2, 2; Masson, p. 45.
