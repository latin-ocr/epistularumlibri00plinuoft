calls dormitorium cubiculum. For membrum in the sense of
an apartment cf. v. 6, 17, multa in hac membra ; Cic. ad Quint.

suspensus et tubulatus This passage was apparently sup-
ported on pillars and fitted underneath with pipes which
circulated the hot air (vaporem). The temperature of the
clm-mitorium membrum could thus be regulated from the
passage by a servant, without disturbing the master. For
other allusions to this method 01 heating cf. §⁶23; v. 6, 25.

cenatio. That Pliny distinguishes between the cenatio and
