etiam viro gravem. Burdensome even to a man who can
manage business better than a woman, not only on account of
the debts which would have to be paid, but also on account
of the expensive sacra privata which the heir was compelled
to keep up. It is true, however, that a woman could some-
times get rid of the latter by passing, by a fictitious sale
called coemptio, into the potestas of some man, who thus
became possessor of her property along with the sacra
privata. He at once manumittcd her and gave her back her
property as a gift, retaining the sacra. This coemptio was
often made with an old and poor man whose poverty induced
him to make the bargain, and who was sure to die in a reason-
able time, the sacra dying with him. Cf. Cic. pro Murena,
ch. 12.

reputation and honour of the dead.'' For this sense of pudor
