19. transmittitque. ‘⁸‘ Circulates ’ by means of the north-
eastern windows.”

20. in capite xysti, ete. “ At the head of the terrace and
portico successively (deinceps) is a garden suite of rooms.’'
The xystus and cryptoporticus were parallel. and the diaeta
was at the extremity of the former and extended also
(deinceps) to the extremity of the latter. This seems the
only possible explanation of deinceps. Keil brackets crypto-
porticus horti, and the omission of these words would
certainly make the passage easier.

amores mei, “my favourite‚⁷’ cf. Cic. ad Att. ii, 19,
Pompeius, nostri amore-s ,· ibid. xvi. 6, Piliae salutem dices et
Atticae, deliciis atquc amoribus· mez's,· and frequently else-
where in Cicero.

in hac heliocaminus etc. “In this (diaeta) is a sunny
chamber, which looks on the terrace on one side, the sea on
another, and the sun on both; also an apartment, which
looks on the portico through folding-doors, and ou the sea
through a window.''

21. eontra parietem medium. ‘⁶ In the middle of the
wall,’' i.e. of the cubiculum.

zotheca.. recedit. Cf. v, 6, 38, mox zothecula refngyz'c quasi
in cubiculum. The zotheca was an alcove or recess in a room,
used for privacy. The word occurs only in Pliny, and in
Sidonius Apollinaris, but it has also been found in aTiburtine
inscription, and also in a Reatine one quoted by Corte. Some
say that zotheca originally meant a den for wild beasts, on no
good grounds that Ι can discover. Ι much prefer Scheffer’s
suggestion that zotheca is formed on the analogy of ζωγράφος,
a painter, and probably meant a place adorned with paintings
and sculpture.

specularibus Cf. 54, note.

modo adicitur etc. ‘⁴ Can either be thrown into the adjoin-
ing room, or be cut off from it.’'

cathedras. “ Easy chairs.'' They appear to have had
backs.

a pedibus mare etc. As you lay on the couch on your side
you had the sea at your feet, the neighbouring villas behind
you, and the woods at your head.

tot facies locorum etc. “All these views may be looked at
separately from each window, or blended into one prospect.''
