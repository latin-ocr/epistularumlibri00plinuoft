108 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM I.

C. Geminium. Letters to him vii. 1. 24, viii. 5, 22, ix. 11, 30.
Keil, however, in all these places reads Gemino, relying
chiefly on MS. Med. In that case a different person is probably
referred to. See Mommsen in Keil, p. 423.

destinasse, cf. note 011 i. 8, l.

revocari ad vitam, “ induoed to live on,” cf. i. 22, 9.

10. Iulius Atticus. 1 cannot identify him, as Catanaeus
does, with the Atticus addressed by Martial vii. 3, 2.

κέκρικα. “ Ι am resolved.'' The other reading κέκμηκα must
mean ‘⁵ my illness is over,” “ enough of illness.’'

11. scio. For similar repetition, cf. ix. 21, 2, irasceris,
scio .· ec irasceris merito, id quoque scio.

superstitibus suis, “leaving a family to survive him'' ; a
consolation, not a sorrow, to a Roman to whom the con-
tinuity of the family was so important, as it was rarer at this
period.

12. firmissimi, “vigorous ’³ 3 cf. infirmnm, sec. 13. Others

4, 3, vii. 23, l.

vitae meae testem. Cf. iv. 17, 6, ille (Corellius) meus in
petendis honoribus suffrassator (et testis.

in summa. Ad summam is more frequent in the more
classical writers, but in summa is also found. ,

contubernali Calvisio, 22⁶3. C. Calvisius Rufus. To him are
addressed letters ii. 203 iii. 1, ]9; v. 73 viii. 2; ix. 6. He was
a decurio of Comum, v. 7, 3. 4.

XIII.

[Q] Sosius Senecio is probably the same man to whom P.
addresses iv. 4, though Catanaeus makes the latter person
Sosius Papus. He must not be confounded with Herennius
Senecio mentioned in i. 5, 3; see note. Sosius was a friend
of Plutarch, who dedicated to him his “Lives '’ ancl several
other writings.

proventum. Corte compares Quint. xii. 10, 11, efflorescat
oratorum inqens proventus. For other examples see Forcellini.
Cf. also Demosth. de Cor„ 245. 61, φορὰν προδοτῶν. 'We are
reminded of the first words of Charlotte Bronte‘s Shirley.
