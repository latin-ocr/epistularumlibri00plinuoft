NOTES xvr-xvn. 169

1. Laurentinum, i.e. praedium. The other form Laurens fre-
quently occurs.

gratiam, “the charins.''

opportunitatem loci, ‘⁶ how convenient its site, and what a
stretch of shore it 001nmands.''

2. secessit, “it is distant.⁷’ He speaks of the villa as if it
were a man retiring from the town.

salvo iam et composito die, ‘⁶ that without loss or interrup-
tion to your working (lay, you can go and stay there.’' Salvo
die means “without taking any time from the dies solidus”
(the time devoted to business„ cf. Hor. Odes i. 1, 20, nec
partem solido demere cle die. Composito die means “having
finished your business day '’ ; cf. Verg. Aen. i. 374, ante diem
clauso componet Vesper Olympo (lay the day to rest). If
there is a tautology in this and peractis quae aqencla fuerint,
it is a very common one, and to me not as offensive as it is to
Gierig and others.

Laurentina et estiensis. The I'z'a &stirmis ran along the
left bank of the Tiber to Ostia. From thence it was continued
under the name of the Via Severiana, along the coast south-
ward through Laurentum, Antium, and Circeii, till it joined
Ι the Via Appia at Tarracina. The Via Laurentina led direct
to Laurentum, bnt branched off from the Vico Ostiensis at a
short distance from Rome. The two roads exist at the
present day. ·

utri-mque excipit, etc„ “the rest of the way in either ease
is rather sandy.”

iunctis, “ for a carriage. ’'

3. facie-5, “ the prospeet‚” ‘⁴ the scenery.’'

montibus hieme depulsa, “driven down in winter (or by
the winter), grow sleek in a pasturage and temperatnre like
those of spring.” This does not refer, as Gierig says, to the
springtime, when the cattle are compelled by the melting snow
to leave the mountains. Pliny’s Laurentinum, as we may see
throughout this letter, is a winter villa, and the cattle in
winter come down to enjoy a temperature which even then is
vernal. Depellere is used of the herdsman; ef. Verg. Eelog.
i. 21, where the word undoubtedly bears this meaning. Here
we may regard either the winter or the herdsman as the agent.
