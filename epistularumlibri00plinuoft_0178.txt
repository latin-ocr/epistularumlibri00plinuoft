ἐνθυμήματα. The word ἐνθυμ. is not used here in its logical
sense, viz. ι syllogism from probable premisses (συλλογισμὸς
ἐξ έίκότων ἤ σημείων), or with later logicians, a syllogism with
one premiss suppl essed but in the sense of rhetorical argu-
ment or conclusion (liawn from contraiies. Examples are: --
eam qvam nihil accusas, (lamnas. id quod scis prodest nillil,-
id quod nescis, obest. Cf. Cic. Topica, ch. 133 Quint. viii. 5,
9, seqq. The MSS. readings vary in this passmge and conse-
q'uently the e(lit01s.Gierig has melna ενθυμήματα καὶ νοήματα.

entur omnes et omnes improbarent. Tacit. uses both ec and que
in this sense. Agric. 9, severus ec saepius misericors. Ann.
