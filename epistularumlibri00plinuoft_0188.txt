150 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM ΙΙ.

2. artissimos laqueos. Pliny harps on the same string as
ini. 10, 9. See note.

numquamne. An echo of Horace's wish, Sat. ii. 6, 60 (read
preceding lines), ο rus! quaudo te adspiciam.

abrumpam. Cf. use of word in i. 12, 8, note on abrupit.

3. tot nexibus etc„ “ by so many ties and links is the chain
of my engagements made longer and longer every day.''
Nemes in this simple sense occurs only in post-Augustali
prose. We are here reminded of Goldsmith's Traveller,
⁸⁴ And drags at each remove a lengthening chain. '³ Notice the
very rare but original sense of affinem—a drawing out, or some-
thing drawn out.

VIIII.

To Domitius Apollinaris Pliny writes, v. 6, describing his
Tusean villa. In ix. 13, 13 he is spoken of as Consul
desigynatus.

To Sextus Erucius Clarus (or it may be to his father,
Erucius Clarus) is addressed i. 16. For further details see
Mommsen in Keil, p. 409.

1. anxium habet, “worries me‚’' “keeps me anxious.''
Habere with adjective or passive participle as predicate de-
notes persistence or continuanee of a state or action. N agels-
bach, Lat. Stil. ἓ 110; Roby ξ 1402. Compare the use of the
Greek ἔχω.

pro me altero, “for my second self.” Cf. Cic. de Amicit.
xxi. 80, est enim is quidem· (i.e. mnicus) tanlquam alter idem ;
Aristot. Eth. ix. 4, 5, ἔστι γὰρ ὁ φίλος ἄλλος αὐτός.

et alioqui. “and besides.'’ A favourite phrase of Pliny,
and seems to be peculiar to him and the elder Pliny (Hand,
Tursell. i. 238). Praeterea or ceterum would be the Classical
word.

2. latum clavum. The latus clarus was a broad vertical
purple stripe running down the sront os the toga, generally
inwoven in the eloth, and distinguished the senators from the
equites, who wore the anqusfus clavus, Sueton. Aug. 38,
says that Augustus allowed the sons of senators the privilege
of wearing it, thus giving them an entry into the senate and
ει means of becoming familiar with its business. The same

privilege was also granted to the sons of equites, as in the
case of Ovid and his brother (cf. Ovid, Trist. iv. 10, 28).
