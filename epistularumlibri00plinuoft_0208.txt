170 O. PLINI EPISTULARUM ΙΙ.

For depellere in the sense of “weaning‚'’ cf. Verg. Eclog. iii.
82, depulsis haedis; vii. 15, depulsos α lacte agynosy· Georg. iii.
187, depulsus ab ubere matris.

usibus capax, “large enough for every comfort.'’ Capaz·
usually takes the genitive.

non sumptuosa tutela, “not costly to keep in repair.’' Cf.
iii. 19, 2, alteram (villam) rancum tueri ,· Paneg. 51, idem tam‘
parcus in aedificando quam diliyens in tuendo ; Cic. Verr. i.
8, 130, aedem Castoris P. Iuni‘zcs habult luendam. Sumptuosa
tutela is abl. of quality. Roby, ἕξ 1232, 1309.

4. porticus, ‘⁶ cloisters.'' The portica-s was a covered pro-
menade supported by pillars.

in D litterae. The readings vary between D, O, and Δ.
The choice lies between the two former. Of these D seems
preferable, for if Pliny had meant a complete circle, he would
probably have so expressed himself, without using a letter of
the alphabet.

quibus parvula etc., “inclosing a small but handsome
court.''

festiva may, as Castell (Villas of the Ancients) says, referto
a mosaic pavement. Hc notes also that Pliny only uses this
epithet of what he considers a masterpiece of art or nature:
cf. iii. 6, 1, Corinthium sianum festivum ; v. 16, 1, qua puella
nihil unquamfestirz'us vidi.

egregium adversus etc. Some make this a new sentence,
and read hae after effre-qiam, on the ground that eyreyium
adversus is an awkward apposition, because too many words
intervene between it and porticus, and also because, without
such a word as hae, the succeeding words contra mediae
would be too far from porticus. The reading hae is supported
by the Florentine and Dresden MSS. On the other hand, it
does not appear in the Medicean and Vatican. I see nothing
awkward in the apposition.

specularibus, “ glazed windows‚’' made of lapis specularis
(talc), a transparent stone which was first found in Hispania
Citerior, and afterwards in Cyprus, Cappadocia, Sicily, and
Africa. The best came from Spain and Cappadocia. It was
easily split into very thin plates ; cf. Pliny Nat. Hist. xxxvi.
22. It was also used in the windows of lecticae. J uv. iv. 21,
quae vehitur ebuso latis specularibus antro.

imminentibus tectis, “ over-hanging eaves.'’
