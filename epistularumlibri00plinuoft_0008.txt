debted, like all modern editors of Pliny, to Mommse’ s
exhaustive article in Hennes III. (1868). A French

translation of the article by C. Morel (187 3), contain-

ratione in Plinii Epistularum IX. libris observata (1872)

The plan of Pliny's Laurentinian Villa was drawn
after consulting Castell's V illas of clm A ncients (London,
1728). Castell's plans are too elaborate, and perhaps
the one I give is also open to that charge. - But if it
serves to present a fairly definite picture to the
student's mind, my object will be gained, and the
reader who is not satisfied with it will have at least a.
groundwork on which to raise his own Laurentinum.

My thanks are due to Mr. S. Dssl, late High Master
of the Manchester Grammar Sehool, and the Revw. Y.
Fausset of F ettes College‚ Editor of Cicero pro Cluentio,
for having read the proof-sheets of the Notes, and
made important corrections and suggestions.
