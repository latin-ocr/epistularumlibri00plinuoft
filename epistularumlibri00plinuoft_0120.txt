82 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM I.

IIII.

Pompeia Celerina was the mother of Pliny’s second wife
(Doring wrongly says first). She was probably the second
wife of Vettius Proculus, who is described in ix. 13, 13. as
‘remoris meae, quam (miseram, vitricus. She was evidently
rich, and in iii. 19, 8. Pliny speaks of getting money from
her, and using her purse as his own. Besides the estates
mentioned in this letter, we learn from vi. 10, 1. that she
had another at Alsium, on the coast of Etruria, which formerly
belonged to Verginius Rufus. Cf. also i. 18, 3.
