himself thus at the beginning of a letter in which he states,
further on, that he is inconsolable.

coreffius Rufus, cf. iv. 17, 4, where P. speaks of his obliga-
tions to him in a letter in which he promises to appear as
advocate for his daughter Corellia in a suit. In this same
letter we get one of his dying remarks to his daughter,
“Multos quidem amicos tibi in longiore vita paravi, prae-
cipuos tamen Secundum et Cornutum.'’ In vii. 11, we find
P. selling his share in an estate to Corellia, sister of Corellius,
at a lower sum than it might have commanded in an auction.
because of his affection for her brother and also for her
husband Minicius Justus In ix. 13, G, P. says hc was in
the habit of referring everything to Corellius, who, he says,
was far-sceing (quem proi-identissimum aptatis nostrae sapien-
tis-Nimiumque comzori), but rather cautious and slow to act
(cunctantior cautim-qun).

exulcerat, “ aggravates. ’'

ex natura nec fatalis, “neither natural 1101· inevitablest'
Ea: natura and finialis mean the same thing, though some
would understand fatalis mors as a violent death, such
as that by drowning, murder, falling of a house, etc.
Aulus Gellius, Noct. Att. xiii. 1, with reference to Cic.
Phil. i. 4, mulla mihi impendere ridentur praeter naturam
fliam praeterque fatmn, discusses whether Cic. took praeter
naturam and. praeter fatum in the same or in two different
senseS, and inclines to the first opinion. Cf. Verg. Aen. iv.
696, vam quia uec fato, *merita nec morte peribat, Ι sed misera
ante diem. Here a violent death is not regarded as happen-
ing fizto. sslors ex natura et fatalis means, in fact, one
brought about by what Cic. de Senect. ii. calls naturae
necessitas. Cf. also Cic. Phil. xiii. 33 ; xiv. 31.

2. utcumque. Almost = although, ‘⁶ However true it may
be that there is great comfort.’' I do not agree with Sheffer
and Gierig, who join utcumque with magynum.

finiuntux=moriuntur. For finire used absolutely, cf. Tacit.
Anu. vi. 50, sic Tiberius finivit (i. e. decessit); Quint. ix. 4,
138, denique uc semelfiniam.

ex ipsa necessitate, “from the mere fact that their death
is natural.'' Cic. de Senect. ii.‚ nihil potest malum videri
quod naturae necessitas afferri-t.

arcessita mors, “a voluntary death.’' Tacit. Ann. i. 5,
