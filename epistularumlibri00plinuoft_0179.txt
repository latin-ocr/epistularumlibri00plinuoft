4. ad tantam ἕξιν “such readiness.‘’ Cf. Quint. x. 1, 1,
where he defines ἕξις as firma facilitas = “ a well established
readiness.'’ Quint. proceeds to say that it is a usual subject
of discussion whether this ἕξις is aequired most by writing οι·
by reading or by speaking.

⁵. scholasticus tantum, “only a rhetorician.'' Opposed
to nos qui insero verisque litibus terimur. Cf. i. 24, 4.

terimur. Cf. vii. 3, 3, terere in hac turba = “kuoek about

were harassed by lawsuits”; vii. 5, 2, unum tempus llis
tormentis caret, qno in foro amicorwn litibus conteror.

multum malitiae addiscimus, “leam many new tricks.’'
Malitia here used in its better sense. For the ill meaning of

ancients the western limit of the world. Cf. Juven. x. l,

ut viderat. Note the use of indicative instead of subjunc-
tive in a relative clause in oratio obliqua. The usage is
common in Sallust, Livy, and Tacitus. Roby, ξ 1798.

ἀφιλόκαλον, inlitteratum, “boorish and unscholarly.’'

non putare tanti cognitionem, “ not to think such a study
worth the trouble.⁷’ Barthius is wrong in supposing a geni—
