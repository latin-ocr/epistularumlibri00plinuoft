v. ll, 3. o diem laetum notandumque mihi candidissimo
calculo ; ovid, Met. 15, 41.
mos erat antiquus niveis atrisque lapillis
his damnare reos, illis absolvere culpa.
6. libem quos emisimus, i.e. de ultione Helvidii (eatam).
Cf. iv. 21, 3 ; vii. 30, 4; ix. 13.
in manibus esse, “to be still in circulation.⁷’ Horace,
Epist. ii. l, 53. Naevius in manibus von est et montibus
haeret? For the same phrase applied to the writer:“to
be on hand,'⁷ cf. Cic. de Senect. xi. 38, septimus milti Oriyinuni
liber est in manibus,
gratiam novitatis, “ the eharm of novelty.”

III.

To Caninius Rufus of Comum are addressed letters ii. 8.
iii. 7. vi. 21. vii. 18. viii. 4. ix. 33. He wrote Epic poetry,
and from viii. 4. we learn that he was contemplating a poem
on the Dacian war. (For the Dacian wars of Domitian and
Trajan see Mommsen, Provinces of the Roman Empire, vol. i.
p. 219, Merivale vii. 340.) From vii. IS we find that he
endowed a feast for his townsmen in imitation of Pl³11y’s
munificence.

1. suburbanum (praedium).

porticus verna semper “ that cloister where it is always
springtime.” Probably because the porticu-s was sheltered
from the extreme heat in summer and from the extreme cold
in winter. Cf. v. 6, 31. porticus· ante medium. diem hiberna,
inclinato (Iz'e aestiva. Martial, i. Epi. 12—

hic rudi-s· aestiva-s· praestabat porticu-s· umbras.

Also Hor. Od. ii. 15, 14. But the porticus may also have
been surrounded with evergreens and beds of rosae hibernae,
and this may be another reason for its spring-like appearance.

platanon, “plane grove.'’ platanus arboris yrun-§⁸ qvod
umbrae tantum ffl‘atia expetitur (Forcelh'ni). It is called caelebs
in Hor. Od. ii. 15, 4. because it is not used for supporting
vines. There are numerous allusions to the platanus in
classical writers. See especially the account of it in Plin.
Nat. Hist. xii. 1. Cf. Martini de platano Cordubensi, crevit
