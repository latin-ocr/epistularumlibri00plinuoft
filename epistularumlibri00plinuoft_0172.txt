Trajan did receive the title of optimus, as we learn from
Paneg. ii. 7, iam quid cam cizide, tam senatorium, quam illud
additum α nobis optimi coquo’men? But the sueceeding
words (quod peculiam huius et proprium adroyantia priorum

take tranquillam, with Gierig‚ aszotium, aud would make it

Doring says, “rehearsing his speech, ” as the words liber, quem
forte acceperat mundiorem show. His speech to the emperor
could not have taken up a large volume. For the phrase cf.
