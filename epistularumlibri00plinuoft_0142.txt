priores, “the men of former times? such as Cicero. Cf.
note on i. 5, 11 (eloquentia saeculi nostr-U: not, as some take
it, priores epistulae. Cf. Tacit. Anu. iii. 55, vnec omnia apud

poetry in the Augustan age, so far as I can discover. On the
whole passage most commentators quote Seneca. Epist. 15,

XII.

About Calestrius Tiro we learn from vii. 16. that he served
in the army along with Pliny, that they were Quaestor-es
Caesaris together, that Tiro held the Tribunate of the Plebs
the year before Pliny, but that they were colleagues in the
Praetorship, that P. and he often visited at each other's
country seats, and that he was made Proeonsul of Baetica.
ln vii. 23. P. says that he loves him as a brother. To him
are addressed vi. l. 22 (where P. adw‘ses him, under a recent
example, to keep his own counsel while in his province) ; ix.
Γ). where P. eommends his treatment of the provinoials.

1. si iactura dicenda est ete, “If loss is a. strong enough
word to express my bereavement of so great a mau.'’
[actura was the term applied¹ to the throwing overboard
of part of a ship's cargo during a storm, in order to save
the ship. Of course the least valuable articles would be
sacrificed; cf. Cic. de Off. iii. 23, quaerit, si in mari iactura
,facienda sit, equine preciosi potius iacturam saciat, an servuli
vilis. Pseudo Sallust, ad Caes. ij. 55, de illis potis-simum
iactura fit, quia pretii minimi sunt. The word came to mean
'‘loss '³ generally. But it is evident that in P. ’s time and in
P.’s ear it must have had an echo of the old sense, i.e. the
loss of things that could best be spared, and so in the pre-
sent passage he does not think it strong enough. Ernesti
would explain iactura by comparing ii. 1, 10, εἰ tamen fas est
aut flere, aut omnino mortem vocare, qua tanti viri mortalitas
nzayisfinita quam vita est, tle. if it is right to designate as loss
the ending of the mortality rather than the lq‘fe of such a man.
But, as Gierig says, it is rather out of place for P. to console
