164 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM II.

applaud. Note the curicus use of the verb. I can find no
authority for the translation ‘agreement is made with an
agent,’ convenire being only used impersonally in this sense.
Corte’s reading is sequuntur auditores actoribus similes, conducti
et redempti mancipes .· convenitur in ‘media basilica, ubi tam
palam, ete.

basilica. The basilica Iulia. Cf, i. 18, 3, note. As the
four centumviral courts met in the same place. the media
basilIca would be the rallying point for these hirelings.

sportulae. sportula, a diminutive of sporta (σπυρίς) a
basket in which doles of food were carried off by poor clients
from the houses of their patrone. Hence applied to the dole
itself which sometimes, as probably in the present case, took
the form of money (100 quadrantes r: about one shilling). See
Diet. of Antiq. sub. voe. For lively allusione to the sportula
of. Juven. i. 95-126, 123 ; iii. 249; x. 463 xiii. 33, the latter
passage being speeially to the point here.

(clamore) quanto Faesidium laudat vocalis ayentem
sportula.

Quint xi. 3, 131, speaks with disapprobation of pleaders, cum
iuter moras laudationum aut in aurem alicuius* loquuntur aut
cum sodalibus iocantur aut nonuunquam acl librarios suos
ila respiciunt, ul sportulam dictare videantur.

5. ex iudicio ete„ ‘ ‘they will pass from one court to another
for a similar bribe.''
σοφοκλεΐς. So called from their crying σοφῶς = “bravo‚”
with probably a pun on the Greek tragedian’s name. Cf.
Martial i. 3, 7, audieris eum yraude sophos; i. 76, 9,
praeter aquas Helicon el ww lyrasque dearum
nil habet el maquum, sed perinane s op Ῐιο s.

Other exclamations were eu, euqe, belle ,· cf. Pers. i. 48,

secl rectifi21emque extremumque esse recu-so
euye tuum et belle.

laudiceni. People who praise for the sake of a dinner.
There is no ground for supposing that there is an allusion to
the town of Laodicea. Some editors take σοφοκλεΐς and
laudiceui as referring to the advocates and not to the auditore,
but wrongly.

6. foeditas, “ this low practice. ''
