100 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM 1.

X.
To Attius Clemens is also addressed iv. 2.
1. nunc, εἶθ. under Trajan.

2. cum adulescentulus militarem. At about twenty Pliny
served in Syria as military tribune of the third Gallio legion.
Cf. also iii. 11, 5, Artemidorum (philosophum) iam tum, cum
in Syria tribunus militarem, arta familiaritate complexus sum.
(See Mommsen in Hermes iii. 78.)

penitus et domi etc, “ I knew him intimately in his private
life.'' Cf. iv. 17, 5, inspexi enim penitus.

obvius et expositus, “accessible and open to all.” The
two words in this sense are late Latinity. Cf. Tacit. Ann.
ii. 2, prompti aditus obvia comitas. Gierig aptly contrasts
Horace's description of Maecenas, Sat. i. 9, 56, difficiles aditus
primos habet.

3. atque utinam etc„ “and I pray that I may have ful-
filled the hopes which he then entertained of me as largely as
he has added to his own merits.'’

aut ego nunc, “or is it that Ι now ’' etc. For a similar
use of aut in introducing a correction or new suggestion cf
vii. 13, 2, aut es tu super omnes beatus.

4. fictore, ‘⁶ a statum-y.” nisi non = von m'sz', “ only.”

5. advertant, “ attract.” Cf. ix. 26, 6, omnis enim advertit
qaod eminet et exstat.

latitudinem, “stilliiess.'' Catanaeus would here discover
an allusion to the derivation of Plato's name from πλατὺς
(according to some from the fullness of his language, according
to others from his broad chest). There is no ground for
the supposition. Latus is often used of style or speech. Cf.
i. 20, 193 Cic. Brutus 31, ut Stoicorum adstrictior est oratio,
¹<ic Academicorum liberior et latiom· Quint. x. 1, 106, ille
concludit adstrictius, hic latius, i.e. the periods of the one are
more concise, those of the other fuller3 xii. 10, Aeschines
nonne his latior etc.

effingit, “he exhibits,” “reproduces.’' Quint. x. 1, 108,
mihi videtur Iis. Tullius effinxisse vim Demostheni-s, copia-m
Platonis. Copiam in this passage is = latitudinem.

inpellat, “ overpowers. ”
