says, in explanation of this use of (lum, that it is the eon-
tinuance of the time, not its completion, that is thought of.

δυσκαθαίρετοντιΙξῘΙῑη-ιῗίθτη, ατί *hulme-tandm (Catan.): “hard
to overturn.” The metaphor is from a building, and is con-
tinued afterwards in the words haec concussa labantur.

locuples: for the wealth of Regulus cf. ii. 20, 13. From
Mart. vii. 31. we learn that Regulus had farms in Umbria,
at Cales in Campania, in Etruria, and at Tusculum.

factiosus, “ has a strong party.’⁷ For this use of the word
cf. Sall. Jug. chs. 8. 15. 27; Cat. 51.

curatur=“is courted’'=colc'lar.· cf. iv. 2, 4. (speaking of
Regulus), convenitur acl eummz'ra celebritate. cuncti detestantur
oderunt, el quasi probent, quasi (liliatum, cursant swquencanl.

ut haec concussa labantur, ‘⁶ that this influence of Regulus
may be shaken and fall to the ground.” Cf. Livy, Praef. 9.
labente clez'mle paulatim disciplina velut desidentes primo
mores sequatur animo, deinde ul massis *massisque lapsi sim,
lam ire ceperint praecipites.

infida, “ inconstant.'⁷

experimentis, “experience;” frequent in post-Augustan
literature and in Pliny. Cf. ii. ll, 6. V. 15, 3. viii. ll, 2. ix.
33, 6. x. 87, (19) 3.

16. mihi et tentandi, “ whether I shall make any move or
remain quiet, Ι shall have good grounds for what I do, if I
follow his advice.'’

ratio constat is said of an account when properly
balanced. Hence it comes to be used of anything that
can be approved of, or has good grounds for its existence,
or can be satisfactorily accounted for. Catan. says ratio
constabilzerit lesyilima causa. constal enim ratio quando
aequa ec leqitima reddi potest, and he quotes from Valer.
Max. iv. 8, l. liberalitatis cluo sunl maxime probabiles sontes,
veram iudicium el honesta benevolentia. nam cum ab his
oritur, tzmc demum ei racio constat. It is a favourite phrase
with Pliny. Cf. i. 9, 1. ii. 4, 4. iii. 18, 10. vii. 6, 4. ix. 2, 5.
x. 3, (20) 3; Pan. 383 Tacit. Ann. i. 6. eam conditionem esse
imperandi uc non aliter ratio constet qaam .ςί uni reddatur.
