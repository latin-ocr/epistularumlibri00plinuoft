INTRODUCTION.

LIFE OF PLINY THE YOUNGER.

PL1NY THE YOUNGER, as he is usually called, to dis-
tinguish him from his uncle the naturalist, was born
at Comum on the Lake Larius. From an inscription 1
we learn that his original name was Publius Caecilius
Secundus. He appears to have had an elder brother
who must have died early, and of whom we know
nothing, except that his· name was Lucius Caecilius
Valens. The same inscription shows that the name
of Pliny's father was L. Caecilius Cilo, and that he
had been IIII. vir aedilicia potestate at Comum, that he
made a bequest to the citizens of Comum‚2 and that
he died young. The Caecilii had evidently been long
established in Comum, probably from 59, B.C.‚ when
under Caesar’s conduct 6 large accession of colonists
was settled there. This is confirmed by the well-

known lines of Catullus, 35,
poetae tenero, meo sodali,
velim Caecilio, papyre, dicas
Veronam veniat, Novi relinquens
Comi moenia Lariumque litus.
