Octavius Rufus was an intimate friend of Pliny, and ac-
cording to him a poet of no mean merit. Cf. ii. 10, where
Pliny urges him to publish his poems. The Baetici (in the
south-east of Spain) were prosecuting Gallus, and were
desirous of obtaining as their advocate Pliny, who had always
been their friend. On the other hand Gallus seeks through
Octavius Rufus either to obtain Pliny’s advocacy, or, failing
that, his neutrality. Pliny here replies, refusing to appear
for Gallus, but at the same time promising not to appear for
the Baetici.
