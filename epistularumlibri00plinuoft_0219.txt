NOTES xvn. -xvnn, 181

XVIII.

1. About Junius Maurich see i. 5, 10, note.

preceptorem. It was not a private tutor that Mauricus
required, as the succeeding context shows, but a public
teacher of rhetorio, whose lectures his nephews might attend.

fratris. L. Junius Arulenus Rusticus. About him, see i.
5, 2 note, also i. 15, where Pliny, at the request of Mauricus,
recommends a husband for the daughter of Arulenus.

resumo. Occurs only in the poets and post-Augustam

prggiiiliis, i.e. my literary and forensic pursuits.

2. loquebantur, i.e. iuvenes.
ordinis nostri, i.e. senatorial. Grown-uppeople frequently

attended these lectures.
probe discere, “attend the lectures with advantage.'⁷

Probe means without getting harm to their manners or
character from such associates.

8. profitentur, “teach.'’ This absolute use of the verb is
post-Augustam Cf. iv. ll, 1, audistine Valerium Licinianum
in Sicilia profiteri ? Ibid, Sec. 14, translatio est in Siciliam
ubi nunc profitetur. For the Ciceronian use, cf. Tuscul. ii. 4,
quod in eo ipso peccet, cuius profitetur scientiam. Ibid. artem-
que vitae professu-5, delinquit in vita. The noun profess-or,
oceurring in Pliny twice, and in Quintilian besides, is also
post-Augustan, and was used especially of a public teacher of
rhetoric, but was extended to teaehers of any liberal art,
quite in our modern sense.

4. mag-is. amares, “ love them more than if they were your
own.’' Gierig, who cannot see how a man can love children
more than if they were liis own, would not understand liberi after
tui. The sense would then be, “than that your children, l
would say your wards (tui) did you not love them more than
as a guardian‚'' ete. But this meaning is forced, and what
Gierig objects to is only a very common hyperbole.

XVIIII.

Cerialis may be Velius Cerialis, to whom iv. 21, about the
death of the sisters Helvidiae, is addressed.
