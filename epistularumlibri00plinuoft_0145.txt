valetudinem viridi-m Verg. Aen. v. 295, Euryalus forma iu-
siqui viridique inveneri,- Ibid. vi. 303, sed cruda [leo viridisque
senectus ,· Tacit. Agric. 29, omni-s· iuventus et quibus cruda ac
viridis senectus ; Ovid Trist. iv. 10, 17, frater ad eloquium
viridi tendebat ab aevo ; Ibid. Ars. Amat„ viridemque
iuve7ztam‚· cf. also our “green old age. '’

vicit et fregit3 the one word emphasizes the other, as often
in Cicero.

indignissima, “ cruel,’' because undeserved. So often in
Ovid. Cf. Ars. Amat. i. 532,

inclismo teneras imbre riyante yerzas.

6. Domitiani temporibus. Trajan was now ruling.

¹7. hoc moris, i.e. of dismissing his slaves ; Roby‚§1296.
If habebant be read it will refer to servi.

8. circumtulit oculos. To look for spies τ it was Domitiani
temporibus. Cf. Merivale vii„ 385.

latroni, Domitian. Not the gout, as some foolishly suggest.

dedisses, “ If you could have given.'' For the omission of
si, see Madvig. Lat. Gram. §442 a. More frequent in the poets.
Corte quotes Martial iii. 38, 8, audieris dices esse M aronis opus.
In Pliny cf. iv. 30, 4, anulum, seu quid aliud ponis in sicco,
adluitur sensim ,· vii. 18, l, numeres reipublicae summam.

exact parallel occurs in Hor. Sat. i. 3, 15, decies centena
dedisses, etc.

fecisset quod optabat, i.e. he would have killed Dom. with
his own hand. Not, as Catan. says, he would have outlived
Dom., for he did outlive him, and took an active part in
public affairs under Nerva, as we learn from iv. 17, 8, vii.
31, 4, ix. 13, 6.

tamen, i.e. though he did not kin Dom., he outlived him.

minora, i. e. than that of his country. Cf. sec. ll, republica
quae illi omnibus suis carior erat.

9. valetudo, ‘⁶ his disease.”

perseverantem constantia fugit, “by his resolution he
escaped its persistency‚'' i. e. by his resolution to die by star-
vation. Constantia may be in the nominative, but it does not
alter the meaning. There is no reason to suppose with
Gesner that Pliny intended an oxymoron in constantia suffit.
