Ep. v, 6, 25, quoted abov.e Observe the uses of piscina and
baptisterium in ecclesiastical writers

12. mare aspiciunt. Ηο10, as in all house baths, the pro-
spect was an important factor. Cf. Seneca's ironical words
(Ep ist. 86), blatta-'7 za vocant balnea, sw' qua non ita aptata sunt, uc

sphaeristerium. The tennis court was necessarily close
to the bath, the exercise in the court being the usual pre-
liminary to the bath. It appropriately faces the warniest sun
in the afternoon, because the Romans took their exercise
then, and also because they usually exercised naked. In the
Tuscan Villa (v. 6, 27) there is also a sphaeristerizmz, quod
plura yeneya exercitationis, pluresque circulos (parties of
players) capit.

turris The term is applied by the Romans to any part of
a building which rises above the other parts by one or more
storeys. This turris apparently consisted of three storeys.
On the first (sub qua) were two sitting rooms, · on the second
(in ipsa) two more3 011 the third or higher storey a certano,
Which would of 0011150 command a very wide prospect.
In describing the second tam is Pliny apparently begins with
the top storey. Diaeta, besides meaning a single room, some-
times means a suite of apartments. Cf. v. 6, 21, est in hac
diaeta dor'wmtov ium cubiculum, etc.

13. sol nascitur, ete. Cf. §6‚ note.

apotheca. Probablyawine- cellar. Itwasusuallyintheupper
storey of the house (H01ace Od. iii. 21, 7, descende testa), and
generally in connection with the heat or smoke of the bath

¹ furnace, though that seems impossible 111 the present instance.

horreum. We cannot determine the use of horreum, ex-

cept that it was a store- room of some kind or other. The word
1s used' 111 various senses. Thus PL. v viii. 18,11 11505 it of a
repository· for pictures and statuary‚1nd some think that is
the sense in the present passage. Horace uses it in the sanie
sense as apotheca. Od. iii. 28, 7,
