186 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM ΙΙ.

Blaesus was uncle of Sejanus, had commanded three legions
in Pannonia, and also been pro-consul of Africa in the reign
of Tiberius. He was poisoned by Vitellius. His son,
Junius Blaesus, held the military tribunate, and was also
governor of Gallia Lugdunensis. Tacitus (Ann. vi. 40)
mentions two brothers Blaesi, who had held priesthoods and
been deprived of them by Tiberius, and who committed suicide.
One of these was the last mentioned, and they were both sons
of the first mentioned Junius Blaesus.

1. novissima valetudine : ii, l, 9.

novis tabulis, “an alteration of the will.” Tabulae ‘novae
also means a cancelling of debts. There is no allusion to
that meaning in the present passage, as Corte thinks.

captare. The usual word for legacy hunting. Cf. Hor.
Sat. ii 5, which is a complete exposition of the arts of the
captator. Cf. iv. 2, 2, where Regulus is said to have
played the captator to his own son.

8. vertit adlocutionem, “he altered his tone''; adlocutio in the
sense of “address'' post-Augustam.

bona morte, “ an easy death.” For the opposite, cf. iii. 16,

demand one more story? But scholasticus can hardly be used
as: σχολαῖος, nor can tertiam be simplyzatiam. The passage
evidently refers to the rule insistes} on by some rhetorieians

· that every speech should be divided into three parts, a rule of

which Quintilian disapprove33 cf. Inst. Or. iv. 5, 3, quaprop-
ter ne illos quidem probat-erim qui partitionem vetant ultra tres
propositiones extendar& and he adds, (partitio) hoc tamen
‘numero velut leffe non est αῖῖίῃαηάα, cum possit caasa
plures desiderare. For scholasticus cf. i. 24, 4, note 3 ii. 3, 5.

10. pulcherrimas tunicas. The Romans wore two tunicae,
an under and an upper. Corte says it was the custom for
people on the point of death to adorn themselves with hand-
some gar-ments. But here we need only suppose that Aurelia.
had dressed specially for the eeremony of will making. The
