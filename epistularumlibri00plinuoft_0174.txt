sacerdotes nominare. The priests referred to are the
augurs. In chublican times the election to this priesthood
was by cooptatio, but afterwards the appointment lay in the
hands of the emperor. The College of Augurs seems, how-
ever, to have preserved the privilege of nominatio by which
they could indicate the person whom they deemed worthy of
election. Pliny, as we see here, was repeatedly nominated
by Verginius, and from iv. 8, 3 we learn that he was subse-

succeeded, for several consecutive years before he obtained
the pricsthood.

the olassical de, which Kraut says occurs, so far as he has
observed, only four times.

si fas est aut flere. These words suggest Naevius’ epitaph,

tion, vivit enim ete.‚ suggests that of Ennius, nemo me
lacrumis decoret nequa funera fletu fiscwic, cur? volito viru’
sacr ora virum. Probably Pliny had both in his mind.

11. postquam ab oculis recessit: ef. i. 16, 8, note.
12. vanis imaginibus etc„ “in dreams, idle it may be, but
