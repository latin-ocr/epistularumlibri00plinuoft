A postscript to the preceding letter.

nescio an satis, circumcisum tamen etc, “ has been pruned
and trimmed, I will not say as much as it ought.'’ He means
to say that the case has been finished, though perhaps the
verdict is not severe enough. Some punctuate nescio an satis
circumciswn, tamen ec adrasum est, and regard circumcisum as
the stronger word, ‘⁶ if it has not been thoroughly pruned, it
has at all events been trimmed.” The metaphor is from
‹rardeuing. Some discox er in the wolcls an allusion to the
lzomo comptas et pumicatus in the preceding lettel. For this
use of nescio an cf. ii. 2, 1, note.

l 2. noto, “which you already know,” from the pleceding
effssgine movendum, “ degraded from the rank of senator.”
