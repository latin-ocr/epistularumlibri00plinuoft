176 C. PLINI EPISTULARUM II.

patitur, “hears‚'' or “is exposed to.'’ An artifieial use of
the word confiued chiefly to poetry. Translate “which,
when the sea is stormy, only hears its roar and thunder, and
even that in subdued and dying murmurs.'’

gestationem: cf. i. 3, 1, note.

14. aperto vento. An incorrect expression due, of course,
to a kind of attraction by aperto caelo = loco venti-3 aperto.

15. vinea tenera et umbrosa. If tenera be taken as
“ young,” umbrosa seems an unsuitable epithet, except we
understand it of the trees to which the vines were trained.
Gierig takes tenera to apply to the path through the vinea ,-
bnt then umbro-sa comes in awkwardly between vinea tenera
and the succeeding words. Perhaps it is better not to take
tenera in too strict a sense, but to regard it as a stock epithet
of the vine, as it actually was. Cf. Mart. Ep. iv. 13, 5, nec
melius teneris iunyzmtzcr vicibus ulmi. Translate “a dainty
and shady alley of vines.'' For m‘nea the Aldine Ed. reads
vinca = κληματὶς δαφνοειὸής. Scheffer reads via.

mollis et cedens: cf. i. 3, 1, mollis et tamen solida, note.

nudisque etiam pedibus. Perhaps Pliny followed the ex-
ample os his favour-ite, Vestricus Spurinna (iii. l, 8.)‚ and
sometimes walked naked in the open air before his bath.

hortum morus et ficus. The Romans, like the Greeks, had
a very limited flora, and they tried to make up for this
defect by variety of arrangement in their gardens.

malignior, the opposite of beniqnior. A specialised use
of the word: “churlish,'' “niggardly,'’ from the general
idea of ill-nature. Cf. Verg. Georg. ii. 179, difficiles primum
terrae, collesque maliqni. Aen. vi. 270, lunae sub luce maliqna.

hac facie, zsse. the prospect of the garden.

cingitur. “It is closed in behind by two day-rooms.'’
The Medic. MS. reads vincitur, which some editors have
adopted, considering cinglitzcr inappropriate along with a teryo.
In either case the meaning will be much the same.

quarum fenestris subiacet, “whose windows command a
view of,” cf. i. 3, l, note.

vestibulum. The entrance to the villa from the main road.
It was, strictly speaking, not a part of the villa. It some-
times consisted of an arched roos supported by pillars.
